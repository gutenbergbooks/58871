<h3>CHILDHOOD—1866-1875</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I am an American musician and have lived in this
country since my ninth year. I was born in Breslau,
Silesia, on January 30, 1862, and my first memories are
connected with war, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.
I was four years old and remember being with my mother
in a room in our apartment in Breslau, which was filled
with flowers and growing plants (mother always had a
marvellous gift for maintaining and nursing plants) and
various friends coming in to condole with her over the
death of my baby brother, Hans, who had died of cholera,
which was then raging in Breslau. The second child of my
parents, born in 1860, had been christened Richard, after
Richard Wagner, who had officiated as godfather at the
ceremony. This child lived but a short time, and Wagner
had vowed that he would never again stand as godfather
for the children of any of his friends, as the ill luck which
had pursued him all his life was thus carried even into
their families.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to safeguard the rest of her children from the
danger of the dread disease to which little Hans had succumbed,
my mother took my older brother, Frank, myself,
and a baby sister into the country near the Bohemian
frontier, where the war was being fought. I can remember
my brother and myself standing at a country
road, each armed with a huge bouquet of flowers we had
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
gathered, and watching for General Steinmetz and his
army to pass on their way to the front. As they marched
by, my brother bravely ran to one of the officers and gave
him his flowers, but my courage gave out and I threw
my bouquet so that it fell on the ground, from which one
of the soldiers smilingly picked it up and stuck it on his
bayonet. That same afternoon Frank and I lay on the
ground with our ears closely pressed to it and we could
plainly hear the booming of the cannon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When peace was declared, King William of Prussia
(afterward Emperor William the First) together with
Crown Prince Frederick, Bismarck, Moltke, and a brilliant
retinue of officers, made their triumphant entry into
Breslau on horseback. My brother and I watched this
gorgeous sight with delighted eyes from the balcony of
our apartment. My mother threw a wreath, which
fell on the neck of the horse carrying King William and
he, looking up, saluted her.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Musical conditions when my father first came to
Breslau in 1858, immediately after his marriage, were
miserable enough, and it was not until he founded, together
with some musical enthusiasts, the “Breslau
Orchester Verein” that a regular symphonic orchestra
was established with a series of subscription concerts.
All the great artists of the day came to Breslau to take
part in these concerts, and generally they stayed at our
house, although our quarters were very simple—Liszt,
Wagner, von Bülow, Clara Schumann, Tausig, Joachim,
Auer, Haenselt, Rubinstein. Some of them I can remember
vaguely, but of course many stories and anecdotes
were current in the family regarding their visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Tausig, Liszt’s greatest piano pupil, spent a
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
night in our house, the bed in the guest-room broke down
in the middle of the night and he calmly arranged his
mattress on the floor and continued his slumbers. But
his visit was connected in my brother’s and my mind
particularly with a certain apple pudding which he
adored and which my mother always baked especially
for him, so that it became known in our family as the
“Tausigsche Apfel-Speise.” It was a luscious mixture
of apples, raisins, and almonds incased in a delicate,
light pie-crust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father and Tausig would sometimes engage in the
most violent discussions on musical or philosophical
topics, and the latter would often become so enraged that
he would rush out of the house, vowing he would never
return. Then he would run around the block and come
back in five minutes, smiling and saying, “Come, Damrosch,
let us play a Beethoven Sonata together,” and all
would be well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Joachim arrived he found a large</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Willkommen Herr Joachim</span>”</p>

<p class='noindent'>in green leaves over the door of our music-room, carefully
arranged by my brother and myself. We adored him
because he loved children and would cut all manner of
wonderful figures out of paper for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Liszt came on especially to officiate as godfather at
the christening of my older brother, Frank (Franz),
who was named after him, but, as I was not born at the
time, my memory of it is not very vivid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once when Hans von Bülow arrived for dinner, my
mother herself had roasted a hare in his honor. To her
despair she discovered at table that she had seasoned it
with sugar instead of salt, but Bülow, perfect gentleman
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
that he was, asked for a second helping, insisting that
sugar always improved roast hare immensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My favorite reading at the age of eight was a wonderful
edition of Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey” in a fine high-sounding
metrical translation by Voss and with many
beautiful illustrations by Friedrich Preller, of Weimar,
at whose house my mother (Helene von Heimburg) became
engaged to my father. As a result of reading these
very exciting Greek chronicles I constantly enacted scenes
therefrom. My mother’s clever fingers fashioned for me
from silver paper and pasteboard helmet, armor, and
shield; and as Achilles I would drag Hector (my little
sister, Marie) on my chariot (two overturned chairs)
around the walls of Troy (the dining-room table).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the winter there was always skating on the Oder,
and I remember, aged seven or eight, being given money
to buy a ticket of admission and to skate to my heart’s
content. Part of this ticket had to be retained and given
up on leaving the ice. Of course I lost this ticket and
being refused egress by the uniformed attendant, I dismally
skated about for hours, becoming more and more
frightened as the sun went down and the river became
more and more deserted. I thought I would have to
remain there for the rest of my young life, and it was a
very tear-stained and miserable little boy who ran
toward the dear Tante Marie who, having become anxious
at my absence, had come to see where I was and
who released me, by payment for another ticket, from my
dreadful imprisonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tante Marie is a younger sister of my mother’s who
came to live with us at the age of sixteen and who became
my mother’s closest helper during many years of storm
and stress, whose gentle and patient self-sacrifice have
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
never failed her and who, thank God, is still living and
as wonderful as ever, the last link with that dim past of
long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think I was somewhat afraid of my father in those
days. He was rather stern and taciturn. Life was hard
and the struggle for existence difficult. He was somewhat
severe about my studies and as those were the days
when whipping children for naughtiness was considered
an essential of their education, I received my share of
such punishment. In fact, sometimes I was whipped in
school and then had to take my school report home to
my father and he would perhaps repeat the dose. But
with all that I was very proud of him and used to enjoy
trotting by his side along the promenade on the banks of
the Oder, because so many people would take off their
hats to him deferentially as he passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also gave us children a good deal of his time in
reading to us books that would stimulate our imaginations
and cultivate our instincts for the beautiful—Grimm’s
and Andersen’s “Fairy Tales,” the “Arabian Nights,”
and some of the parables from the New Testament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whenever I was sent supperless to bed or confined
to my room for some misdeed, it was always mother who
would comfort me and perhaps bring me a plate of soup
or dessert secretly and talk to me gently until my obstinacy
would melt and I would be ready to knock at
my father’s study and ask his forgiveness. Once I did
not dare, but instead drew a picture of myself standing
penitently at his door and underneath the words: “Seven
times seventy times shalt thou forgive.” This I shoved
under the door into his study and it produced the desired
effect, as it brought my father out and in a very forgiving
mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
One of my sins was that I simply could not bear to
eat spinach, and as in those days it was considered the
absolute duty of a child to eat anything that was put before
him because “God had grown the spinach and other
vegetables in order to feed hungry children,” and “there
were thousands of poor little children who would be only
too glad to eat spinach,” I was forced to eat it although it
often choked me and made me ill. Even to this day I
cannot bear spinach, and with all the reverence and deep
affection that I have for my father, I do not think he was
right in this particular case as regards his pedagogic
theories.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The following excerpts from letters of von Bülow throw
an interesting light on the conditions under which my
father worked in Breslau at that time.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1870 the papers were filled with accounts of “the
outrageous insult of King William by the French ambassador,
Benedetti,” and the hostile attitude of Emperor
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
Napoleon the Third. War was declared and of course
we boys immediately began to indulge in imitations of
the military drill of the soldiers of our city. The most
exciting and welcome news to me at the time was that my
piano teacher had been drafted and I had high hopes of
not having to continue to undergo the dreary necessity
of daily finger exercises, but alas, my hopes were rudely
dashed to the ground when a bald-headed substitute
appeared to continue the lessons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon the trains were coming in, bringing the wounded,
and the French prisoners, among whom the dark-skinned
Zouaves and Turks especially excited our interest. We
looked with envy at the older boys of our school who,
having studied French, used to go up to the French officers
and ask them whether there was anything they could do
for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war ended and my young piano teacher returned,
resplendent in his uniform with shining brass buttons,
in which he paid his first ceremonial visit to my father
and mother. My mother, wishing to put him at his ease,
asked him to tell something of his experiences in the war,
but he was not very articulate. Yes, he had been at the
beleaguering and capitulation of Metz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wonderful,” said my mother, “and what happened
to you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, they—they—shot at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was all we could get out of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile my father had become more and
more discontented with musical, social, and political
conditions in Breslau. He was really a Republican at
heart and the Prussian bureaucracy, which had become
more and more accentuated by the war, irked and angered
him. With greatest difficulty he could make a bare
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
living for his family, and he found the population of
Breslau, except a small band of devoted followers, steeped
in materialism and not particularly sympathetic toward
art, especially the modern German composers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1871 my father received an invitation through Edward
Schubert, the music publisher of New York, to
come to America as conductor of the Arion Society, and
while this opening was small enough, it seemed to offer
him an opportunity through which better and bigger
things might develop and under conditions more free
than were possible in Germany at that time. He therefore
determined, at forty years of age, to take the plunge
and to precede his family to America in order to find out
whether a living and a new career might be made possible
in the New World. The Arion Society occupied an honorable
position in the social and musical life of the Germans
living in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can remember his farewell concert, in Breslau, at
which he performed Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
There were laurel wreaths, and chorus ladies in white,
and there was a general atmosphere of enthusiasm and
of many tears, but my memories are connected particularly
with my astonishment at seeing my teacher of arithmetic
whom I hated, suddenly stand up in the middle
of the parquet during the intermission and ogle the ladies
with a pair of opera-glasses. It had never entered my
childish mind until then that a horrible school-teacher
could be a man like other men in private life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A very tragic happening was that one of my suspenders
burst during the Ninth Symphony, and for the rest of
the performance I was in mortal fear that my trousers
might not “stay put.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After my father’s departure we children, of course,
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
played nothing but sailing off on a ship, again principally
by aid of the parlor and dining-room furniture. We
read “Robinson Crusoe” and enacted its chapters with
great satisfaction to ourselves. It was all good fun to
us, but the anguish of parting from the country in which
they had grown up and lived for so many years, and the
dread of the unknown in a strange land, must have been
terrible for my father and mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally came an enthusiastic letter from my father
bidding us to follow him to New York; we accordingly set
sail, August, 1871, in a little ship of the North German
Lloyd, the <span class='it'>Hermann</span> from Bremen, my mother, Tante
Marie, Frank, myself, and two younger sisters. I was
desperately seasick for several days until one Sunday
morning, when, as I was lying on a bench on deck, the
young captain rudely kicked me off, saying, “Look here,
youngster, you have been ill long enough, now brace up,”
which I did and enjoyed the rest of the trip immensely.
The captain was in a very romantic mood because he was
to marry a young American girl on his arrival in New
York. In the evenings my mother would sing Schubert
and Schumann on deck and the captain several times gave
us firework displays, rockets, etc., in honor of his approaching
nuptials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we arrived in New York we found my father
anxiously pacing the wharf where he had been waiting,
since early morning, for eight hours, to take us in a carriage
from Hoboken to a house in East 35th Street which
he had rented and furnished completely from top to bottom
as a surprise for my mother. The hot and cold water
on every floor, the gas and the carpets were a revelation
to us, as these modern conveniences were hardly known
in Breslau at that time. My youngest sister, Elizabeth
(now Mrs. Harry T. Seymour), was born in this house.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
My brother and I were immediately put into the primary
department of Public School No. 40 in East 23d
Street, and as we did not know a word of English we were
entered in the lowest class, although I had already been
in the Sexta of the Gymnasium (High School) and my
brother in the Quarta, and I had studied Latin and he
both Latin and Greek. But we dutifully spelled out <span style='font-size:smaller'>CAT</span>,
<span style='font-size:smaller'>DOG</span>, etc., until after a few weeks of this we were promoted,
and so these promotions went on with lightning rapidity
until we had acquired English and could enter a class more
appropriate to our years, nine and twelve respectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continued my studies of piano under an old teacher,
Jean Vogt by name, and after his return to Germany I
studied with Pruckner, von Inten, Max Pinner, and
Boeckelman. The last, feeling that I could not raise my
fingers high enough from the knuckles, gave me a machine
of steel springs which, through rings attached to the
fingers, were to lift them higher than nature would permit.
Unfortunately this contrivance brought about a
weakness in the third finger of my right hand from which
I have never quite recovered and which unfortunately, or
fortunately, has prevented me from becoming a professional
piano virtuoso. But I had acquired a good technic
and a singing quality of tone which served me well
years after when I began to give recitals at the piano on
the Wagnerian music-dramas, at which I played the
orchestral part on the piano while I recited the text and
explained the various musical motifs and their relation
to the text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first appearance in an orchestra was, I am sorry
to say, a rank failure. I was only a boy of fourteen years
and my father had prepared a charming operetta of
Schubert’s, “Der Häusliche Krieg,” for a “Summer
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
Night’s Festival” of the Arion Society. In this occurs
a delightful March of the Crusaders with one loud clash
of the cymbals at the climax. It did not seem worth
while to engage a musician at “full union rates” for this
clash and I was, therefore, intrusted with it. At rehearsals
I counted my bars rest and watched for my cue
with such perfection that the cymbals resounded with
great success at the proper time and in the proper manner,
but at the performance, alas, a great nervousness fell
upon me and as the march proceeded and came nearer
and nearer the crucial moment, my hand seemed paralyzed,
and when my father’s flashing eye indicated to me
that the moment had come, I simply could not seem to
lift the cymbals which suddenly weighed like a hundred
tons. The march went on but I felt that the entire evening
had been ruined by me and that every one in the
audience must know that I had “funked it.” As soon
as I could I slipped out of the orchestra pit underneath
the stage and into the dark night, feeling that life had no
joy left for me. I could not bear to hear the rest of the
opera or to meet my father’s reproachful eye.</p>

<h3>BAYREUTH IN 1876—MY DOLL’S THEATRE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1876 Wagner inaugurated the Bayreuth
Theatre with the first production of his great
“Nibelungen Trilogy.” All the old friends and the musicians
who had been in the forefront of the fight in the
early days when Wagner’s genius was not generally recognized,
gathered there from far and near in order to be
present at what was destined to be a magnificent demonstration
of the final triumph of the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father, naturally, was keen to be there and to rejoice
with his old colleagues. He had not returned to
Germany since he had left it in 1871 to found a home for
his family in the New World. He had never regretted
this step, but many bonds of sentiment and many old
friends drew him to Europe. Alas, he had no money for
such a trip and there seemed no way of obtaining it.
There was a lottery formed by a few Wagner enthusiasts
the proceeds of which should go to the Bayreuth Fund.
The winner of the lucky number was to receive a ticket
for the first performance, and my father bought a number,
but of course he did not win, and there was the price of
the steamship passage to pay and the expenses of maintenance
in Europe besides. In his despair he told his
old friend Schirmer, the New York music publisher, of
his distress and Schirmer immediately said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor, you simply must go, and here is a loan of
five hundred dollars, which you can repay me whenever
you can afford it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
This was so friendly and generous an act that it gives
me pleasure to record it here, especially as his two sons,
Rudolph and Gustav, also continued on terms of friendliest
intimacy with me from boyhood to their all-too-premature
deaths. Another friend of my father, Charles A.
Dana, the great editor of the <span class='it'>New York Sun</span> asked him to
write some articles on his Bayreuth experiences for <span class='it'>The
Sun</span> and paid him another five hundred dollars, so that
my father was liberally supplied with funds for his trip
to Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This visit, the reunion with Wagner, Liszt, Raff,
Lassen, Porges, and hosts of other old friends, together
with all the marvels of the first production of the “Nibelungen
Trilogy,” refreshed my father immensely in body
and spirit, and when he returned home and recounted to
us all the glories of the trip, I fairly ached with the joy of
it and immediately proceeded to spend all my pocket
money in the making of a very remarkable doll’s theatre
about three feet wide and equally high in order to produce
Wagner myself. I painted all the scenery and the actor
dolls for it, and had the most brilliant lighting effects and
a curtain that went up and down with a perfection not
always witnessed even on the real stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I had some talent for painting and had attended
the drawing classes at Cooper Union, I knew something
of colors and perspective and delighted especially in designing
interiors of palaces with dozens of pillars which,
beginning in large size at the proscenium, would dwindle
down to the smallest pillarets, gradually lost in the dim
distances, so that my palaces always looked as if they
were miles long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My fellow director was my boy friend, Gustav Schirmer,
son of the publisher, and our first production was, of
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
course, a Wagner music drama. Gustav’s mother was
an enthusiastic Wagnerite who eventually spent much of
her life in Bayreuth and Weimar. “Rhinegold” seemed
to me especially fitted for our theatre as it offered almost
boundless scenic opportunities. The effect of water in
the first scene which is supposed to depict the depths of
the Rhine, I achieved very successfully by several alternate
curtains of blue and green gauze, and behind the
rocky reef in the centre of this scene a gas-burner was
very cleverly hidden, the light of which, as it gradually
increased in strength, brilliantly simulated the awakening
of the “Rhinegold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The united children of the Schirmer and Damrosch
families together with their elders constituted the audience.
The children paid fifty cents admission, but both
Gustav and I permitted our respective parents to contribute
as much above that as their generosity would
permit, and we looked on it as very much the same kind
of a subvention as the king of Bavaria had allowed Wagner
at Bayreuth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The theatre had been very cleverly placed in the doorway
between two rooms, but as the piano was in the same
room where the audience sat, I had to rush backward and
forward continually. For instance, when Gustav pulled
the curtain to disclose the depths of the Rhine, I played
the Rhine music, then would creep back under the table
on which the theatre was placed and help him manipulate
the Rhine Maidens. Then I would rush back again to
play the music accompanying the awakening of the Gold
and so on until the change of scene when, as the rising
sun shines upon the mighty walls of Walhalla, I would
reproduce the stately harmonies of the Walhalla motive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I look back on it now, it must have been an absolutely
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
crazy performance, but the audience was hugely
delighted and contributed so liberally that my co-director
and I had a surplus with which to begin preparations for
another play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some parents on reading this may think that all this
was a huge waste of time, but I cannot agree with them.
Quite apart from the fact that it taught me a good deal
in the use of the brush, it was a great stimulus to the
imagination and a welcome outlet for the desire all children
have to live in a make-believe world of fancy. At
any rate, Gustav Schirmer and I can claim that we were
the first to produce Wagner’s “Rhinegold” in America,
and it is possible that this was the germ for my decision
eighteen years later to form the Damrosch Opera Company
solely for the purpose of producing Wagner throughout
America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dolls’ theatre was, however, not my only diversion
from my school and musical studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one Christmas my father and mother gave me a very
complete tool chest, with which I fashioned, among other
things, a dolls’ house for my sisters and quite a little fleet
of boats. I remember one three-master, about three feet
in length, the wood for which I obtained from a foreman
at the Steinway piano factory, then situated on Park
Avenue. This three-master with all sails set won several
races for me on the pond in Central Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those days, Central Park was considered very far
uptown, and where now the palaces of millionaires flank
its borders, Irish squatters lived in improvised huts around
which goats would gain a meagre livelihood from the
rocks stretching on all sides. These squatters established
a kind of lien on the land, which I believe was recognized
as having some legal force when the property became
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
more and more valuable and the owners began to
grade the land for residential purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as in the early days in Breslau, we continued to
celebrate Christmas Eve in America in the good old
fashion. Weeks before, a delicious atmosphere of mystery
and secrecy began to envelop every member of the
family. The “front parlor” became taboo for us children.
Packages began to arrive and were stored there. The
Christmas tree, which was always carefully chosen by my
mother and which, according to old regulations, had to
touch the ceiling with its top, was brought in in the evening
after we had been carefully “shooed” upstairs into
our respective bedrooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dozens of sheets of gold and silver paper were cut by
us into glittering garlands for the tree and we were, of
course, expected to present our parents on Christmas
eve with something fashioned by our own hands, or to be
able to recite a poem or play a new piano solo. Of all
this they were supposed to know nothing until the great
day arrived, although they must have heard our dreary
practising of it for weeks before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The celebration was held on Christmas eve, before
supper. My father and mother would disappear into
the forbidden room to light the hundred candles on the
tree and put the last touches on the heaps of presents.
Then my father would play a march on the piano and
we would all troop in and stand breathless before the
tree so beautifully illuminated by the gentle light of
the candles. Our presents would, of course, consist
mainly of necessities in clothing and underclothing,
shoes, etc., which we would have received anyhow, but
which gained an added glow because of the occasion.
But there were always books, and the tree was crowded
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
with cakes and candies and gay-colored paper flowers
and there were toys and joyous singing of Christmas
songs and hymns around the tree. Then would come a
delicious supper, accompanied by a cup of which Rhine
wine and sliced pineapples were the constituent parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper we children had to recite our verses or
play our piano solos, and, alas, these exhibitions sometimes
ended in tears, as the exciting events that preceded this
contribution to the festivities sometimes blunted our
memories and we would get “stuck” in the middle.
Then we would cast a frightened glance at my father, who
would, perhaps, look rather serious until mother’s smile
or some joking remark would put him and us in good
humor again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those wonderful Christmas celebrations of my childhood
continued into my married life. Then when my
children came, besides participating in my mother’s
tree, we tried, my wife and I, to bring into our own home
on this beautiful day a kind of festive celebration which
should pass on to our children and friends that which my
father and mother and Tante Marie had so freely given
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have had some wonderfully jolly Christmases.
My four children and their cousin, Walker Blaine Beale,
took on themselves the loving burden of our entertainment.
A play was sometimes written or charades improvised,
for which upstairs closets were ransacked for costumes
and other paraphernalia in such haste and amid
such ruthless confusion that Minna, our old Swedish
nurse, who has been in our family since the birth of my
oldest daughter, would often throw up her hands in horror
at the bedrooms, which indeed looked as if a tornado had
swept over them. I remember a delicious take-off on
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
“Pelléas et Mélisande” which my oldest daughter, Alice,
wrote. I had given a number of lecture recitals on the
opera the previous season and it was much in the family
mind. Then another year a drama on “The North Pole”
was written. This was just after the dispute between
Peary and Cook as to the discovery of the pole. There
was a real shiver when we were heralded back to our
transformed parlor. The Christmas tree had quickly
become a lonely pine outlined against bleak areas of
farthest north cotton sheets, stretching in all directions
over “hummocks” of sofas and chairs. Our five children,
for Walker seemed as much our very own in these celebrations
as my own four girls, gave us a wonderfully
spirited drama of the conquest of the polar regions!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can see and hear dear David Bispham laugh, my old
friends Doctor and Mrs. George Harris’s enthusiasm,
Margaret Anglin, Julie Faversham.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our happy,
happy Christmases!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last Christmas party at our home was that of 1916.
Then in 1917 Walker was training at Camp Dix and we
all went out with his mother and spent Christmas Day at
an inn near by to which he could come. There was a
rumor everywhere that his regiment was to embark for
overseas in a few days, although he really did not sail
until May. We all did our best to make it gay in that
hotel dining-room, the rain falling dismally. We were
so proud of our young khaki-uniformed lieutenant! My
Polly played and played, rags, anything and everything,
on the old hotel piano. We did not know it was to be
our last happy Christmas together, but war had already
given to joy a kind of yearning anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My nephew was killed the 18th of the following September,
1918, at Saint-Mihiel. Reconnoitring to assure
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
the safety of his men, he leaped a fence to join three
fellow officers. A shell tore them to pieces. This was
in the early afternoon. Walker was taken to a field
hospital and died at eleven that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know that he did not suffer very much, and we
think we know that he never understood how severely
he was wounded, that he never knew that what, as a
soldier, he so freely offered had been accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was his grandfather’s, Mr. Blaine’s, youngest grandson,
only twenty-two, his mother’s only son, our brightest
and best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no day we do not think of him, but Christmas,
the day of giving, is his own especial day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a frigid day last winter (January, 1922) travelling
with my wife on an untidy, dilapidated post-war train
through Germany, on my way to Stockholm to fill an
engagement to conduct the orchestra there, we read in
an English magazine an article on Tennyson ending with
a description of the old graveyard in which lie the bodies
of his two grandsons, both killed in the war. “I did not
know,” I said, looking out over the black wintry flat
German country, “that Tennyson lost <span class='it'>two</span> grandsons in
the war!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But so did <span class='it'>my</span> father,” my wife said proudly, and she
spoke truly, for another nephew, Emmons Blaine of
Chicago was no less a war victim than Walker. Unable
to pass the physical tests required to enter the army he
agonized to find the nation’s greatest need behind the
lines in which to enlist. He chose shipbuilding and
offered himself as a workman at Hogg Island, near
Philadelphia. Although never overstrong, he worked
early and late, and fell a victim of the terrible epidemic
of the “flu,” dying at Lansdown on October 9, 1918.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
Though Walker had already died in France, we knew
only at the time that he was wounded. Of his death
we learned four days later. Thus these two cousins,
Emmons and Walker, are forever enshrined together in
our anguish, in our pride, and in our love.</p>

<h3>FOUNDING OF THE SYMPHONY AND ORATORIO<br/> SOCIETIES OF NEW YORK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In 1873 Anton Rubinstein, greatest of Russian pianists,
accompanied by the violinist Wieniawski, came to America
by invitation of Steinway and Sons. He dined at
our house and expressed wonder that my father had not
yet been able to achieve a position in New York commensurate
with his reputation and capacity. My father
explained to him how difficult the situation was and that
the entire orchestral field was monopolized by Theodore
Thomas. He told Rubinstein that when he had first
arrived in New York he had met Thomas at the music
store of Edward Schubert in Union Square and that after
the introduction Thomas had said to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear, Doctor Damrosch, that you are a very fine
musician, but I want to tell you one thing: whoever
crosses my path I crush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomas at that time really believed that America was
not large enough to contain more than one orchestra,
but he lived long enough to see my father surpass him at
the head of a symphony orchestra, as founder of the
first great music festival in New York and, above all, of
opera in German at the Metropolitan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1881 the first symphony orchestra on a permanent
basis had been founded in Boston by Major Higginson,
and before Thomas’s death there were half a dozen great
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
subsidized orchestras actively operating in the United
States, a number which has since then increased to twelve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rubinstein said to my father: “Why don’t you begin
by founding an oratorio society, and that will lead to
other things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father consulted a few devoted friends, and the
Oratorio Society of New York was accordingly founded
in 1873 and began rehearsals in the Trinity Chapel with
a chorus of about eighteen singers, my mother’s glorious
voice leading the sopranos and my very humble and little
self among the altos. The first performance took place
in the warerooms of the Knabe Piano Company the following
winter, at which time the chorus had increased
to sixty singers. The programme was a remarkable one
for that period, containing a capella chorus and accompanied
choruses by Bach, Mozart, Handel, Palestrina,
and Mendelssohn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this small beginning the society developed until
it became the foremost representative of choral music in
New York, performing, with a chorus of three hundred and
fifty voices, under my father’s direction, the older oratorios
of Handel, Haydn, and Mendelssohn, and such
novelties as the first part of “Christus” by Liszt, the
Berlioz “Requiem” and “Damnation of Faust,” the
Brahms “Requiem,” Cowen’s “St. Ursula,” the choral
finale from the first act of “Parsifal,” and the third act
of “Meistersinger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indirectly, but logically, the founding of the Oratorio
Society led to the founding of the Symphony Society of
New York in 1877, which at last gave my father an orchestra
with which he could demonstrate his abilities as
a symphonic conductor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The differences between him and Thomas were very
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
marked. Thomas, who had educated himself entirely
in America, had always striven for great cleanliness of
execution, a metronomical accuracy and rigidity of tempo,
and a strict and literal (and therefore rather mechanical)
observance of the signs put down by the composers.
America owed him a great debt of gratitude for the high
quality of his programmes. My father had been educated
in a more modern school of interpretation, and his
readings were emotionally more intense. He was the first
conductor in this country to make those fine and delicate
gradations in tempo according to the inner demands
of the music, gradations which are too subtle to be indicated
by the composer’s signs, as that would lead to exaggerations,
but which are now generally considered as
necessary in order to bring out the <span class='it'>melos</span> of a work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both conductors had their violent partisans, and, as
they were at that time literally the only orchestral conductors
in America, feeling ran very high. My father
was the last comer, and Thomas was well fortified in the
field, with a group of wealthy men to support him. The
first years for my father were very hard and a portion of
the New York papers assailed him bitterly, continuously,
and with vindictive enmity. Again and again dreams of
murder would fill my boyish heart when I would read
one of these attacks in the morning paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard work to keep the two societies going and
to enable them to meet the bills for hall rent, soloists,
and orchestra. There was as yet but a small public for
the higher forms of music, and again and again it looked
as if further efforts would have to be abandoned. But
my father persevered and struggled on, making a living
for his family by teaching violin, composition, and singing,
and occasionally getting a fee of “a hundred dollars
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
in gold” as violin soloist or in a chamber-music concert,
officiating as musical director in a church and as conductor
of the German male choral society, the Arion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first production of Symphony No. 1, in C minor,
by Brahms became a subject of intense rivalry between
the two conductors. Brahms had waited until his fortieth
year before writing a symphony, and the work was
eagerly awaited in New York, as the reports from Germany
proved that it had made a sensation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father went to see old Gustav Schirmer at his
store on Broadway and asked him whether the orchestral
score of this work had yet arrived. Schirmer told him
that it had, but that he was in honor bound to give it to
Theodore Thomas as he had promised it to him. My
father was very much chagrined to think that this prize
should thus have escaped him, and he spoke of this very
regretfully to a pupil of his in composition, Mrs. James
Neilson, member of an aristocratic old family in New
Brunswick, New Jersey, and a woman of great beauty and
distinction. Mrs. Neilson said nothing to my father
but quietly went down to Schirmer’s and inquired of the
clerk whether the orchestral score of the Brahms symphony
had arrived, and when he answered in the affirmative,
she asked whether it was for sale. “Certainly,”
answered the clerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thereupon purchased a copy of the score and sent
it up to my father with her compliments. His astonishment
was intense, but she did not tell him until weeks
afterward how she had obtained it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He received the score on a Thursday and the first rehearsal
for the next concert was to take place on the following
Monday. This left but little time to obtain the
necessary orchestral parts and Schirmer naturally would
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
not sell him any. He therefore cut the score into three
parts and divided them among three copyists, who worked
day and night and managed to have the parts ready
in time for the rehearsal. Great was the triumph in the
Damrosch camp at this victory over the Thomas forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some years later I gave the first performances in New
York of the Third and Fourth Brahms Symphonies, but
I had no need to resort to strategem to obtain the scores
and orchestral parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Orchestral conditions were bad compared with to-day.
There was no such thing as a “permanent orchestra.”
The musicians of the Symphony Society, for instance,
played in six symphony concerts during the winter, each
preceded by a public rehearsal. They also officiated at
four concerts of the Oratorio Society, and this was almost
the extent of their efforts in that direction. The rest of
the time they made their living by teaching, playing
in theatres, at dances, and some of them even at political
or military processions and mass meetings. If a better
“job” came along than the symphony concert they would
simply send my father a substitute. Small wonder that
occasionally their lips gave out and the first horn or
trumpet would break on an important note during a
symphony concert. And yet, in spite of this disheartening
condition, my father succeeded in infusing the orchestral
players with such emotional intensity, and in imparting
so lofty an interpretation to them, that the audiences
of that day were often roused to the greatest enthusiasm;
and I would tuck my arm very proudly into his as we
marched home from a concert, even though we knew
that the subscription to the concert was not more than
eight hundred dollars and the single sale at the box-office
had not reached the hundred dollar mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
But all this was changed like a flash in the year 1879
when my father decided to perform “The Damnation of
Faust,” by Berlioz, until then unknown in America.
This concert, which was held at Steinway Hall, in East
14th Street, necessitated the services of solo singers, the
New York Symphony Orchestra, the chorus of the New
York Oratorio Society and the male chorus of the Arion
Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work and the performance made a sensation. All
New York buzzed with it, and during that winter, 1879,
it was given five times in succession to crowded houses,
creating an excitement such as New York had never before
seen in the concert field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I played in all these performances at the last stand of
the second violins, as my father considered it of the utmost
value to me as a future conductor to be able to follow
the conductor’s beat as one of the orchestra.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span><h1>IV</h1></div>

<h3>AUGUST WILHELMJ—TERESA CARRENO</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1878 Maurice Strakosch, an old concert
manager, called on my father and asked him whether
he would permit me to go on a Southern concert tour with
the celebrated violinist, August Wilhelmj, who was then
touring the country under Strakosch management. Mr.
Max Liebling, his regular accompanist, had been taken ill
and as both Wilhelmj and Strakosch knew that I had accompanied
my father a great deal at home, they thought
that I could acceptably fill the position at such short
notice. I was naturally wild with delight at the idea and
prevailed on my father to let me go. I was to receive
the, for me, munificent salary of a hundred dollars a week
and all my railway expenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set forth the following Monday, the company consisting
of Wilhelmj, a soprano singer whose name I have
forgotten, and Teresa Carreno, who was then already a
great pianist and certainly the most beautiful woman I
had ever seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmj, who was exceedingly lazy, refused even to
rehearse with me. Our first concert was in Washington
and I was to accompany him, among other things, in
the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. I was naturally
nervous about it, and to my delighted astonishment, on
the afternoon of the concert, Carreno turned on Wilhelmj,
reproaching him for not giving me a rehearsal and
insisting that rather than put me to such an unfair strain,
she would accompany him in the concerto herself. This
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
was a characteristic act of this remarkable artist and
woman, and I shall speak more in detail about my immediate
adoration for her in another chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Washington Baron von Schloetzer, the Prussian
minister, who was an old friend of my father’s, received
me very kindly, and, to my delight, included me in the
dinner which he gave in honor of Wilhelmj and Carreno.
He was an original and delightful old bachelor and wildly
fond of music, although his only accomplishment in that
line was a real talent for whistling, his <span class='it'>pièce de résistance</span>
being the “Tannhäuser Overture,” in which he would
whistle the “Pilgrim’s Chorus” and the fluttering accompanying
violins seemingly at the same time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At his dinner he treated me somewhat as an older man
would a child, and would tell his butler to my great
chagrin to only half fill my glass because I was too young
to drink as much as the older people. He had several
rare vintages of claret standing on the sideboard and
some of these I was not allowed even to taste, all for the
same reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner both Wilhelmj and Carreno played and
then the beautiful Mme. de Hagemann, American wife of
the Swedish Minister, sang most delightfully. She has
since written charming memoirs of her earlier diplomatic
life abroad, especially of the Court of Napoleon the Third
just before the Franco-Prussian War, entitled “Courts
of Memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Washington we went farther and farther South
and my young mind was tremendously impressed by its
romantic atmosphere, the luxuriant tropical foliage and
the lazy, cheerful life of the “niggers” swarming everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Macon, Georgia, Wilhelmj and I stopped at an old
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
ramshackle hotel in two rooms en suite. We did not
wake up until about eleven o’clock the following morning,
feeling very heavy and headachy, and on examination
found our trunks rifled of whatever valuables they contained.
We had evidently been chloroformed. A burly
detective was engaged by Wilhelmj to take charge of
the case, but of course nothing happened except that
Wilhelmj and I purchased revolvers. His was very large
and mine very small and this is about the only weapon
that I ever acquired, and of course never used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New Orleans was a real revelation. It was then still
an absolutely French city. I was invited to dinner at
several delightful Creole families and French was the
language at table. The old Creole restaurants were at
the height of their glory, and such delicious crabs,
pompano, and shrimps I had never eaten before. Alas,
their nice sanded floors have been replaced by dancing
parquets, and noisy ragtime bands and wretched cooking
are but poor substitutes for their past glories.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>THE MUSIC FESTIVAL OF 1881</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the summer of 1880 my father conceived the
idea of giving a monster music festival in May, 1881,
which was to last a week and for which a chorus of one
thousand two hundred, of which the Oratorio Society
should be the nucleus, was to be trained in sections during
the entire winter. He conferred with some of his
friends, outlined his project to them, and a Music Festival
Association composed of the directors of his Symphony
and Oratorio Societies was formed. Other prominent
New York citizens were added and a guarantee fund was
provided, ample to protect the project financially.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
Although I was only eighteen, my father deemed
sufficiently advanced to intrust the drilling of a great
portion of this chorus to me, a confidence of which I was
very proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire summer of 1880 I spent in the little New
England town of Amherst. A very remarkable Frenchman,
Doctor Sauveur by name, had perfected a new
system of teaching French and Latin, and Amherst College
had turned its buildings over to him for a summer
course. It seemed to my father and me that this was
an excellent opportunity for me to acquire the rudiments
of these two languages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I accordingly arrived in Amherst armed with a grand
piano, reams of music paper, and the orchestral score of
the great Berlioz’s “Requiem,” which my father had
selected as one of the works to be performed at the Festival.
There was no piano score in existence and, to my
joy, my father intrusted me with the task of making one
from the original orchestral score.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I obtained a lovely bedroom from a farmer on the main
street for the opulent price of two and a half dollars a
week, and my grand piano was installed in the parlor, of
which I had the entire use for four hours a day to practise.
My meals I got at the principal little hotel for six
dollars a week and when the genial proprietor saw me
consuming my first dinner he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ef I had known you et that hearty I would have
charged you more. I won’t make nothin’ out of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meals were certainly delicious, and at eighteen
one’s capacity in that direction is unlimited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I arrived in May the college was still in session
and I was made welcome by several of the students,
among them Lawrence Abbott, now editor of <span class='it'>The Outlook</span>,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
and John Cotton Smith, now rector of St. John’s in
Washington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My days were certainly busy ones. In the morning I
attended the sessions of Doctor Sauveur in French and
Latin and in the afternoon I practised piano and worked
hard at the arranging of the piano score of the Berlioz
“Requiem.” Incidentally, I seemed to find plenty of
time for games and fun of all kinds with a delightful
family who had a country place there and where I got
my first real glimpse of American country life, which
is indeed unique and with which no other country can
compare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As fast as the different numbers of my arrangement of
the Berlioz “Requiem” were finished, I sent them on to
my father who, after revising them, gave them to the
publisher in order to have the piano scores ready for the
rehearsals in the fall. He was well pleased with my work,
especially the “Tuba Mirum,” in which he thought that
I had condensed quite cleverly the four orchestras which
Berlioz intended placed at the four corners of the stage
to represent the trumpets of the last judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I returned to New York in September, my
father intrusted to me Section B of the New York Festival
Chorus, numbering two hundred voices and the
Newark Harmonic Society of Newark, New Jersey,
numbering three hundred. He himself drilled the chorus
of the Oratorio Society of four hundred at which I always
played the piano accompaniments, and Mr. Cortada,
an old pupil of my father’s, trained a section in Brooklyn
and another in Nyack, New York. I hurled myself at
my task with such vehemence and enthusiasm that by
the time the Festival came along my choruses were letter-perfect,
but I had become voiceless. My vocal cords
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
had quite gone back on me in justifiable anger at my
abuse of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The choral works to be performed included the Berlioz
“Requiem,” Rubinstein’s “Tower of Babel,” Handel’s
“Messiah,” Beethoven’s “Ninth Symphony,” and shorter
selections. The monster chorus and orchestra numbered
fifteen hundred, and a special stage and sounding-board
were built at the Seventh Regiment Armory at
which the Festival took place. The organ from St.
Vincent’s Church was transferred bodily, and I was intrusted
with the organ accompaniments. An enormous
audience of ten thousand people attended every performance,
and the public acclaimed my father with much
enthusiasm as America’s greatest musician. Such happy,
happy days!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many memories of this great occasion I
can never forget the first rehearsal of the four orchestras
and sixteen kettledrums which Berlioz used in the “Tuba
Mirum” to depict the Last Judgment. This rehearsal
took place in the Foyer of the old Academy of Music in
Fourteenth Street; and as the sixteen kettledrums came
in like one man just as the fanfare of the judgment
Trumpets begins, the effect of these vibrations in a comparatively
small room was so tremendous that one by
one the orchestra men arose and a murmur began which
grew and grew and finally relieved itself in a loud shout
of enthusiasm. It was several minutes before my father
could continue the rehearsal. I have never witnessed
anything quite like it since. We are now so sophisticated
by Strauss and the later-day dissonancers that so-called
instrumental “effects” neither shock nor stir us. And as
regards the dissonances with which some of the ultramoderns
seek to irritate our ears, I have always claimed
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
that the human ear is like the back of a donkey—if you
whip it long enough and hard enough, it gradually becomes
insensitive to pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodore Thomas and his supporters were much irritated
that my father should have “gotten ahead” of
them with so stupendous a musical demonstration, and
they immediately proceeded to copy his idea by giving a
Music Festival the following year in the same building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For me, the immediate result of the Festival was my
election at eighteen years of age as permanent conductor
of the Newark Harmonic Society. This gave me the
long-desired opportunity to produce choral works with
orchestral accompaniment, and for several years I gave
three or four of these every winter, including not only the
older oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohn, but more
modern works like Berlioz’s “Damnation of Faust,”
Rubinstein’s “Tower of Babel,” the Verdi “Requiem,”
and choral excerpts from the operas of Wagner. All of
these concerts my father attended, and after each performance
he would analyze my conducting, praise freely
and enthusiastically where he thought I deserved it, and
also show me where he considered a tempo wrong or
an entrance of instruments or chorus not properly indicated.
My mother and aunt would often lend their lovely
voices in the choruses at the performances whenever I
thought I needed them, but they would always insist in
the most blindly partisan way that my concerts were
wonderful and that I was altogether a very remarkable
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This year marked my real beginning as a professional
musician, and I enjoyed my weekly rehearsals in Newark
immensely, although horse-cars, ferry-boats, and trains
made the trip in those days a cumbersome one. But
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
after each rehearsal Mr. Schuyler Brinkerhoff Jackson,
the president of the society, Mr. Shinkle, the secretary,
my dear old friend Zach Belcher, enthusiastic tenor and
music lover, Frank Sealey, my pianist and since then for
so many years accompanist and organist of the New
York Oratorio Society, used to go with me to a nice
German beer saloon near the railroad station where, over
a glass of beer and Swiss-cheese sandwiches, we waited
until train time and discussed the welfare of the Harmonic
Society and music in general. Alas, the Volstead Law
has ended all such simple and happy foregatherings and
the soda-water counter with its horrible concoctions is
but a poor substitute for the gentle and soothing beer of
Pilsen and Munich.</p>

<h3>LISZT AND WAGNER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1882 I sailed for Europe. My father
wanted me to know his old friend, Liszt, and to hear
the first performances of “Parsifal” in Bayreuth. My
throat was also still bothering me and the doctor thought
that a cure at Ems would be a good thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was naturally overwhelmed at the idea of seeing the
great Liszt face to face. His name had been, ever since
I could remember, a household word in our family. My
father and mother had told me so much of his friendship
for them, his genius and his triumphs as a piano virtuoso,
and of his voluntary relinquishment of all this to devote
himself exclusively to creative work, and toward helping
the entire modern school of young composers. My father
had kept up a desultory correspondence with Liszt during
the years he had spent in America, and as soon as I
arrived in Weimar I went to the little gardener’s cottage
in which he lived to pay my respects to the old master.
I entered his room in great trepidation, and when I managed
to stutter a few words to tell him that I was the son
of Doctor Leopold Damrosch, I was amazed at the kindness
of his reception. He immediately spoke of my father
and mother with such love that I forgot some of my timidity.
He asked me about an opera on Shakespeare’s
“Romeo and Juliet,” which my father had composed in
the old Weimar days but which he had subsequently
destroyed as he was dissatisfied with it. He then asked
me how long I expected to stay in Weimar. I said two
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
days and that I was then going to Ems for a cure and then
to Bayreuth to hear the first “Parsifal” performances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A curious change came over Liszt as I spoke. He repeated
several times, “Two days, ha, yes, ‘Parsifal,’ of
course, Bayreuth.—‘Parsifal,’ of course,” and then he
picked up a box of cigars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, at least you’ll take a cigar before you leave
Weimar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “No, master, thank you very much, I do not
smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should then go to-night to the theatre to hear
the first performance of Calderon’s play ‘Above all
Magic is Love,’ for which your father’s old friend Lassen
has written the music and which he will conduct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I assured the master that I would certainly go, but
sensing a certain frigidity in the air, and feeling that so
unimportant a person as myself must not take any more
time of the great Liszt, I withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening I went to the historic little theatre doubly
hallowed by the productions and ministrations of Goethe,
as well as the memorable times in the fifties when Liszt
officiated there and conducted the first performances of
Wagner’s “Lohengrin” in which my mother had sung
<span class='it'>Ortrude</span>. The theatre was so small that you could almost
see every person in it as in a drawing-room, and to my
astonishment, in the first intermission, one of the servants
of the theatre came to me and asked me if I were Herr
Damrosch. When I answered in the affirmative he said
that Kapellmeister Lassen wished to see me. I followed
him to the stage and was immediately accosted by Lassen
whom I had not met before, but of whom I knew, because
he and my father had been close friends for many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said: “What did you do to the master this morning?
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
I came in just after you left and found him in tears. He
said, ‘a young son of Damrosch called on me this morning,
I thought of course he would stay here and study
with me, but instead of that he told me he was only
going to stay two days. The young generation have
forgotten me completely. They think nothing of me
and they have no respect for us older men of bygone
days. Am I a hotel in which one takes a room for a
night, then to pass on elsewhere?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Needless to say, I was overcome at such a dreadful
development of a perfectly innocent remark of mine. I
could not conceive it possible that so small a person as
myself should have unwittingly brought about so tragic
a result, and I implored Lassen to tell me how I could
efface it. Lassen, seeing my unhappy state, advised me
to go the next morning at eight o’clock to see Liszt again
and to explain everything to him. I sat through the rest
of the play but actually did not hear a word of it or a
note of Lassen’s music; I was too occupied with my
own misery. I did not sleep all night, but tossed about
restlessly and at six arose and wandered about dismally
until seven when a frowsy waiter in the dining-room of
my hotel, the “Russische Erb Prinz” gave me a cup of
coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Punctually at eight o’clock I knocked at Liszt’s door and
as I entered I saw this wonderful-looking old man with
his splendid white hair and deep-set eyes, already at his
work-table. As he saw me his eyebrows arched and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, still in Weimar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came forward and tried to speak, suddenly burst into
tears and then managed to stammer out my great admiration
for him, how my father had always held him up as
the ideal musician of our times, and how he must have
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
misunderstood my words of yesterday if he thought that I
intended any lack of respect or reverence for such a
man as he. As I reread this it seems quite articulate,
but as I told it to Liszt it must have sounded very ridiculous,
but nevertheless I suddenly felt his arms about me
and a very gentle furtive kiss placed upon my forehead.
He led me to a chair, sat down by me and began again to
talk and reminisce about my father and mother. He
then invited me to come that afternoon to his piano class
and I left very much relieved at the outcome of my visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then called on another old friend of my parents and
also of Liszt’s, Fräulein von Schorn. I found at her
house a friend of hers, Baron von Joukowski, a Russian
painter of distinction and a highly interesting man, who
had become very friendly with the Wagner family and who
had designed the Hall of the Holy Grail for the “Parsifal”
production at Bayreuth. When I told them of my experience
with Liszt they explained to me that Liszt had
grown very old, that he felt the modern musical world
was forgetting him and that in choosing a sacred text like
“Parsifal,” Wagner had been, so to speak, encroaching
somewhat on his domain. Perhaps even a latent jealousy
of Wagner’s all-usurping powers was slightly clouding a
friendship and self-sacrifice which Liszt had so abundantly
given to Wagner all his lifetime. They also told
me that Liszt was now surrounded by a band of cormorants
in the shape of ostensible piano students, many of
whom had no real talent or ambition, but who virtually
lived on the master’s incredible kindness, abusing it in
every way and altogether making the Weimar of that day
a travesty on former times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow confirmed this to me several years later and told
me how he had once “cleaned out” Liszt’s rooms and
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
bade this unsavory crowd never to return. Liszt had
thanked him, but next morning they were all back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I attended the audition in Liszt’s rooms that afternoon
and found that there was indeed a pitiful crowd of
sycophants and incompetents assembled, but there were
a few exceptions, notably young Eugene d’Albert who
was then perhaps fifteen or sixteen years of age and who
played wonderfully and to Liszt’s great satisfaction.
There were a few others who, however, did not play on
that afternoon. But another one who shall be nameless,
sat down to play the Beethoven sonata in E flat, Op. 31,
No. 3, and botched the introduction so horribly that Liszt
gently pushed her off the chair and sat down himself saying,
“This is the way it should be played,” and then the
music seemed to just drop from his fingers onto the piano
keys, and such a heavenly succession of sounds ravished
my ear that I did not think it possible human hands could
evoke it. He then said to her: “Now, try it again.”
And she did, and, if anything, played even worse than
before. Again Liszt played the opening phrases, and
then, somewhat irritated, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, blamieren Sie sich noch einmal.” (Now, make a
fool of yourself again.) By that time to our relief she felt
that both she and we had had enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this I met Liszt several times and he always
treated me with uniform cordiality, but every once in a
while the memory of our first meeting would come to
him and he would make some gently malicious remark,
such as “Oh, here comes our young American; like lightning
he flashes through the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Weimar I went to Ems and dutifully took the
“cure” for five weeks, drinking the three glasses of the
more or less miraculous waters while the band played
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
before breakfast, and watching little girls dressed in white
smilingly presenting bouquets of bachelor’s-buttons, popularly
supposed to be his favorite flower, to old Emperor
William, who, accompanied by an adjutant or two, used
to take the cure at Ems every summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To strangers like myself the place on the promenade
at which the French Ambassador, Benedetti, had “insulted”
the King of Prussia in 1870 was always pointed
out, but this was many years before Bismarck’s famous
and cynical confession that it had all been a put-up job
by him in so altering the famous telegram relating to
the King’s meeting with Benedetti that, according to
Bismarck’s memoirs: “It will be known in Paris before
midnight, and not only on account of its contents but
also on account of the manner of its distribution, will have
the effect of a red rag upon the Gallic Bull.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two summers ago, after an absence of thirty-eight
years, I revisited Ems with my wife and daughters. We
had motored from Paris to Coblenz on a visit to General
Allen, then in command of our Army of Occupation in
Coblenz, and from there to Ems was but a short motor
ride. We found the town occupied by French troops from
Morocco, and our officer guides pointed out with some
amusement the stone which marks the place where Benedetti
and King William had met in 1870.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In July I went to Bayreuth in high expectation, to
hear the first four performances of Wagner’s “Parsifal.”
To a young musician from America such an experience
was especially new and exciting. I arrived there a week
or two before the first performance, hoping to gain admission
to some of the rehearsals. I found this impossible,
but I met scores of artists by whom I was cordially received
because I was my father’s son. Many of his old
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
friends were there for the “Parsifal” performances and
I remember with much pleasure the kindly, refined and
gentle Herman Levi, General Music Director of the
Munich Opera, who had been chosen by Wagner to conduct
the Bayreuth performances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I received an invitation for the first reception held by
Wagner and his wife, Cosima, at Wahnfried and dutifully
presented myself there with some nervousness, which
was allayed somewhat when I found Liszt almost at the
door as I came in. He immediately recognized me and
not only introduced me to Cosima, but when she said,
“Father, you must introduce this son of our old friend,
Doctor Leopold Damrosch, to the Meister,” he took me
into Wagner’s workroom where I beheld Wagner surrounded
by musicians and in front of him the giant tenor,
Albert Niemann, well known later on to Wagner lovers in
America as a member of the German company at the
Metropolitan for a number of years, and also as the creator
of <span class='it'>Tannhäuser</span> in Paris at the tragic and disastrous performances
of 1861.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we came in, Wagner was joking Niemann unmercifully,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at this man! I invited him to create the part
of <span class='it'>Parsifal</span> for me and he refused because I told him that
<span class='it'>Parsifal</span> must be a beardless youth and he said he would
not cut off his beard for any man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Meister,” answered Niemann, “you know that
is not true; I would cut off my nose if it were necessary
to sing one of your rôles properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wagner greeted me with kindness, asked about my
father, and a few days later sent me, through his publishers,
for my father, a manuscript copy of the finale
from the first act of “Parsifal” (no orchestral score was
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
at that time engraved) for performance in New York by
the Symphony and Oratorio Societies. This was a remarkable
act of friendship on his part and I was very
proud to be able to carry the precious score back to my
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to me indescribably touching to note the way
in which Liszt sought to efface himself at Wagner’s
house, in order that Wagner’s glory should stand forth
alone. When I first saw Liszt there I, following the custom
of the young musicians at Weimar and elsewhere,
sought his hand in order to kiss it; but, with a force incredible
in so old a man, he pressed down my hand, saying
with his gentle smile: “No, no, not here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I doubt whether there ever was a musician who worked
so incessantly for the benefit of other musicians as he.
He was constantly seeking, either with his ten magic
fingers as pianist or with his pen as musical critic or propagandist,
or with his own money, to save others from want
or to help them to obtain the recognition which he thought
they deserved. It is impossible to name the hundreds
whom he thus benefited—Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, César
Franck, Schumann, Cornelius, and so on, and of course
above all Wagner himself, whose friendship with Liszt
has become historic. Like most friendships, the one gives
much more than he receives, and that one was Liszt, who,
in his admiration for Wagner’s genius minimized himself
and what he had accomplished as composer to an exaggerated
degree. In those personal qualities that make up
a man’s character, Liszt was infinitely the superior.
Wagner’s genius as a musician was the greater, but this
brought in its trail an overwhelming egotism and a vanity
which made many of his relations with his fellow men
unfortunate. Liszt gave up all worldly glories and honors
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
and riches which he might have acquired if he had
continued his career as perhaps the greatest piano virtuoso
that ever lived, in order to devote himself absolutely
to composition and musical propaganda, without
any thought of pecuniary rewards. He literally, like his
patron saint, Francis of Assisi, took the vows of poverty.
When I saw him he lived in most simple fashion, always
travelled “second class” and gave what little money he
had to others who seemed to him to need it more. Without
his never-ceasing support and encouragement, his
absolute faith in the eventual triumph of Wagner’s music,
and without continual financial support from Liszt and
from those he constantly urged to help, Wagner could
never have carried on his struggle toward the triumphant
completion of a Bayreuth and an almost complete realization
of his ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first performance of “Parsifal” made a tremendous
impression on me. I was much moved by the noble
allegory and the music accompanying the sacred rituals
of the Christian Church as presented upon the stage in
the scene during the uncovering of the Holy Grail. But
I must confess that with each succeeding performance
this feeling lessened. The fact that it was not a devotional
ceremony but an imitation of one which had been
carefully drilled and trained into the performers whose
gestures of devotion repeated themselves each time with
automatic regularity, gradually began to affect me disagreeably.
I was at that time too young to analyze
this feeling properly, but, as the years went by, I gradually
arrived at the belief that such ceremonials should not be
presented on a stage, for if we see a group of Christian
Knights partaking of the Lord’s Supper, we should have
the full conviction that it is a real ceremony and not an
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
imitation. The foot-washing scene between <span class='it'>Parsifal</span> and
<span class='it'>Kundry</span> also affected me disagreeably. It was too direct
an imitation of Magdalen washing the feet of Christ.
On the other hand, the Good Friday scene between
<span class='it'>Parsifal</span> and <span class='it'>Gurnemanz</span> moved me and many others in
the audience to tears because it was a lovely and lovable
presentation of the divine mercy through the self-sacrifice
of the Saviour. Old Scaria, the Vienna bass, who took
the part of <span class='it'>Gurnemanz</span>, sang and acted this scene with
convincing tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was naturally much interested in the invisible, subterranean
orchestra of the Bayreuth auditorium, and as
the first noble theme of the prelude literally floated into
the darkened hall, the great advantage of an invisible
conductor was manifest. The division of the music into
bars, which are an essential of the conductor’s beat, should
be seen only by the orchestra, and I still wish it were possible
to educate the public to listen to music with their
ears only and not with their eyes. But this theory of
mine would find violent opposition from the small but
select company of “prima donna conductors” who, at
that parting of the ways which comes to every conductor,
whether he shall make himself an interpreter of the composers’
works or a perverter in order to demonstrate his
own “tricks of the trade,” have chosen the primrose
path because a large part of the public are easily gulled
and more easily moved if the conductor “dramatizes”
the music through his gestures. By the skilful manipulation
of his arms and hands, his hips and his hair, he
gives the impression that when the ’cellos play a soulful
melody, it really drips from his wrists, and when the
kettledrums play a dramatic roll it is really the result
of a flash of his eye. There are many people, especially
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
among the gentle sex, to whom admiration for one conductor
entails a deep hatred of all others. It would be
interesting to note how many of them could pick out their
favorite if half a dozen of the prima donnas of the baton
were to perform invisibly with an invisible orchestra in
quick succession to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strings of the Bayreuth orchestra were noble and
rich in tone, but I was disturbed by many inaccuracies
and false intonations of the wind choir, which surprised
me all the more as the orchestra was supposed to be
composed of the best of every kind from the different
opera-houses of Germany. These faults were not noticed
or acknowledged by my German friends, and I
think that the years have brought more and more of a
cleavage in this respect between their orchestras and ours,
and that to-day American orchestras obtain, especially
in the wind-instrument choirs, greater purity of tone and,
without sacrificing elasticity, a greater precision of ensemble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have always had a penchant for French wood-wind
players and have given them and their Belgian cousins a
preference in my orchestra. Generally speaking, a conductor
can safely engage a first prize from the Paris
Conservatoire in flute, oboe, or bassoon without giving
him any further examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where else can one find a flute of such ravishing tone
quality as that of George Barrère, who has been first
flute of the New York Symphony Orchestra for seventeen
years and who was first recommended to me by his
great teacher, Tafanel, in Paris? I am happy to say that
he is developing many American players and giving to
them something of his own luscious and spiritual tone
quality, so that he, as well as Mathieu, our first oboe, and
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
Lettelier, bassoon, are continuing the great traditions of
the Paris Conservatoire in this country and imparting
their qualities to a group of young American pupils.
Germany has produced some great clarinet players, of
whom Muhlfeld, for whom Brahms wrote his beautiful
“Quintet for Clarinet and Strings,” was a fine example.
Mr. Lindemann, first clarinet of my orchestra, is another,
and his tone is of a peculiarly pure quality. I prefer the
tone of the German trombonists to that of their French
colleagues. The Germans cultivate a darker and more
noble tone quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer of 1886 I returned again to Germany. I
had been invited to conduct some selections from “Sulamith,”
a cantata of my father’s, at the annual meeting of
the “Ton-künstler-Verein” which took place at the beautiful
Thuringian hill town of Sondershausen, the residence
of the princely house of Schwartzburg-Sondershausen,
where the prince maintained a good permanent symphony
orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Liszt, as venerable founder and president of the Ton-künstler-Verein,
an association of musicians the original
purpose of which was the production and cultivation of
the modern school of composition, again received me
very kindly and expressed himself as much pleased at
hearing my father’s work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the Festival I accompanied him, together
with Baron Joukowski and Fräulein von Schorn,
back to Weimar. During the trip Liszt was in a very gay
mood and kept us in gales of laughter with a number of
outrageous puns and amusing comments on certain phases
of the Festival, especially on a long debate between Doctor
Rieman, an eminent musical theorist, and another
man whose name I have forgotten, on certain theories
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
regarding the science of harmony. This debate, which was
wholly technical and very “gründlich” lasted for two
hours, during which poor Liszt had to sit in the front row
in a room crowded to suffocation and with not a door or
window open. I can still see the venerable head of Liszt
drooping and dropping every now and then from sheer
fatigue, and then the Meister raising it again with that
ineffable smile on his face in order to show an interest in
the discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we arrived in Weimar, Joukowski invited us all,
together with Lassen, to dinner at the Hotel “Zum Russischen
Hof.” It was a jolly affair. Champagne was
served immediately after the soup and Liszt reminisced
so brilliantly and beautifully of the old Weimar days of
which Fräulein von Schorn and Lassen had been a part
and with which I, too, could claim some connection
through my parents, that we all sat spellbound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the dinner Liszt asked me if I knew anything
of a portrait of his which had been painted under interesting
conditions many years before. Liszt occupied
rooms at the old Villa d’Este at Tivoli, near Rome, for a
month or two every winter. It then belonged to his old
friend, Cardinal Prince Hohenlohe. One evening his bell
rang, and as his servant had gone out, Liszt took a candle
and opened the door. His visitors were Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, the American poet, who had brought a
painter friend, Mr. Healy, to introduce to the maestro.
Longfellow was so struck with the picturesque appearance
of Liszt as he stood in the old doorway in his long
black soutane, holding a lighted candle, that he asked
Liszt for permission to have Healy paint a picture of him,
and he consequently gave Healy several sittings. Longfellow
took the painting back with him to America.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
I had never heard of or seen this picture, but thirty
years later, when Ernest Longfellow, a nephew of the
poet, was lunching at our house I remembered the incident
and asked him if he knew anything of the whereabouts
of the picture. He told me that he remembered it
very well and that it was still hanging in his uncle’s
house in Cambridge. Through the courtesy of the present
occupants I was permitted to take a photograph of
it and it is reproduced in this book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until midnight that we accompanied Liszt
through the park and the lovely Goethe Garden back to
his house. It was a gentle summer night with a hazy
moon giving an indescribable glamour to the trees and
bushes, and suddenly Liszt laid his hand on my shoulder
and said “Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the bushes came the song of a nightingale. I had
never heard one before and stood spellbound. It seemed
incredible that such ecstatic sweetness, such songs of joy
and sorrow, could come from the throat of a little bird, and
to hear it all at twenty-four years of age and standing
at the side of Liszt! Dear reader, I confess that to-day,
thirty-five years later, I still thrill at the memory of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas! That was almost the last time that I saw Liszt.
In July I went again to Bayreuth to hear the first “Tristan”
performance, and one morning I met him, looking
very old and worn, coming all alone out of the church
from early mass. A few days later, July 31, he had followed
his dearest friend, Wagner, into the beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following winter, in Liszt’s memory (March 3,
1887), I gave the first complete performance in America
of his oratorio, “Christus.” This work made so profound
an impression that I repeated it the following year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am sorry that “Christus” has not been performed
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
since then by our choral societies, as I consider it to be
Liszt’s greatest work. Many of its themes are based on
the Gregorian modes. The choruses are set in sonorous
harmonies and breathe a tranquillity which can only be
achieved by a perfect mastery of the subject and the form
in which it is treated. There are two orchestral numbers—a
Pastorale, indicative of the shepherds and the annunciation,
“Angelus Domini ad Pastores ait,” and the
March of the Three Kings, “Et ecce Stella quam Viderant”—which
are brilliantly orchestrated. The march
depicts the three kings of the Orient with their mighty
retinue, the star guiding them to the manger in Bethlehem
being indicated by a sustained high A flat in the
first violins in an organ point around which the processional
continues. The trio, or middle part, in a beautiful
unison of the violins and violoncellos, depicts the kings
opening their treasures and presenting gold, frankincense,
and myrrh to the little Jesu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entrance of Christ into Jerusalem is characterized
by an atmosphere of exalted, joyous acclaim, and the
setting for baritone of the prayer of Jesus,</p>

<h3>THE FOUNDING OF GERMAN OPERA AT THE<br/> METROPOLITAN—DEATH OF MY FATHER</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Metropolitan Opera House was built in 1882 by
a group of rich New Yorkers who, feeling themselves shut
out by the older aristocracy who owned the old Academy
of Music and occupied all the boxes at the Italian Opera
seasons of Colonel Mapleson, determined to have an opera
of their own. They leased their new house for the inaugural
season of 1883-84 to Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau, a
firm of theatrical speculators and managers who had made
a name for themselves by the tours of Mary Anderson
and other celebrated “stars” of Europe and America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Metropolitan Opera stockholders had appointed as
architect a man whose reputation had been made in
building churches, but who knew nothing of theatrical or
operatic requirements, or of the latest developments in
Europe in the construction of the stage and modern stage
appliances. As a result, the stage arrangements were of
the most clumsy description. Great walls, many feet
thick, ran beneath the stage from the front to the rear,
thereby precluding the possibility of a “transformation”
scene in which one set of scenery could sink into the ground
while the other descended from above. The parquet
floor was placed so low that the orchestra pit, which was
supposed to be an imitation (but was not) of the sunken
orchestra at Bayreuth, had to be placed still lower and
in consequence the conductor was perched on a kind of
pulpit high in the air so that the singers could see him.
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
He had to gesticulate wildly upward toward the singers
and downward toward the abyss in which the orchestra
fiddled without being able properly to see his gestures.
Besides this, the orchestra, being so far from the stage,
was almost inaudible to the singers, and this often resulted
in the most disastrous dropping of the pitch, especially
in the concerted numbers. Years later and at
huge expense some of these faults of construction were
corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For their season Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau engaged a
large number of operatic stars, including Nilsson, Patti,
Sembrich, Trebelli, and many others of distinction, but
there was absolutely no artistic head of the enterprise nor
any one who had had any real managerial experience with
grand opera, and in consequence all these stars stepped
on each other’s feet and trains and the confusion was incredible.
Good performances were an accident, as the
principal artists usually deemed it beneath their dignity
to attend rehearsals, and the season ended in failure
and the bankruptcy of Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau.
Colonel Mapleson, the astute manager of the Academy
of Music, rubbed his hands with glee at this downfall of
what he called “the new yellow brewery on Broadway.”
The directors of the Metropolitan were at a loss what to do
with their elephant. Their president was James Roosevelt,
an uncle of Hilborn Roosevelt who was then president
of the New York Symphony Society and who was a
stanch and devoted friend of my father’s. He suggested
to his uncle that my father be appointed as director and
that a season of opera in German be inaugurated, as
Italian opera was evidently on the wane and Wagner,
especially, on the ascendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The directors thought well of this scheme and accordingly
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
made an arrangement with my father under which
he should become director of the opera for the season
1884-85 and that he should engage a company of German
singers of which, however, Madame Materna must be
one, as she had sung with great success at the Theodore
Thomas Festival of the preceding year and they wanted
some name already known in America to head the list
of singers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This meant a complete revolution in operatic affairs,
as until then Italian opera had been the only fashionable
form of musical entertainment. Opera in German was
rather looked down upon and Wagner’s genius was as
yet too imperfectly known or recognized to exercise much
influence on the opera-going folks of that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father was to receive a salary of ten thousand dollars,
for which he was to act as manager and also as musical
conductor of the season. The salary was certainly
not large, even for those days, but my father was glad to
get it and at the same time to carry out the dream of his
life, the introduction of the Wagner music-dramas to
America, and to sweep away forever the artificial and
shallow operas of the old Italian school with which Mapleson,
Max Strakosh, and others had until then principally
fed our public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sailed for Europe in May and returned in August
with all his contracts made, including Madame Materna,
to whom he had to pay a thousand dollars a night, as
she had gotten wind of the dictum of the Metropolitan
Opera House directors that under all circumstances she
must be one of the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the singers were Marianne Brandt, one of the
greatest dramatic mezzo-sopranos and contraltos of our
times, and Anton Schott, a typical German “heroic
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
tenor,” with whom Bülow had had his famous altercation
at Hanover a few years before at a “Lohengrin”
performance. Schott had sung <span class='it'>Lohengrin’s</span> “Farewell to
the Swan” out of tune and this had so irritated Bülow,
who was conducting, that he turned on the unfortunate
tenor and said to him: “You are not a Knight of the Swan,
but a Knight of the Swine.” Schott, as an ex-officer in
a Hanoverian regiment, deemed his honor as an officer
insulted, demanded an apology or a duel, and as the irate
von Bülow would grant him neither the one nor the other,
Bülow had to resign his post as director of the Royal
Opera, while Schott remained triumphant in his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the youthful lyric soprano rôles my father had engaged
Madame Seidl-Kraus, the wife of Anton Seidl and
possessor of a voice of great purity and simple appeal.
The coloratura rôles were sung by Madame Schroeder-Hanfstangel,
a truly great artist, with the real <span class='it'>bel canto</span>
of the Italian school, whom Gounod had admired so
greatly that he invited her to Paris to sing <span class='it'>Marguerite</span> in
“Faust” at the Grand Opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other singers possessed both the virtues and the
failings of the German Opera School of that time. They
were very amenable to ensemble work, carrying out the
dramatic side of their rôles with real ability, forming an
excellent ensemble, and tireless in rehearsing, but their
singing was sometimes faulty and not equal to the
naturally beautiful tone emission of the best Italian
singers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stage-manager, Wilhelm Hock, was one of the
best in Germany and his management of the movements
of great crowds on the stage, as for instance in “Lohengrin”
on the arrival of <span class='it'>Lohengrin</span> and the <span class='it'>Swan</span>, the building
of the barricades in “Massaniello,” the Coronation
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
Scene in Meyerbeer’s “Le Prophète,” was a revelation to
our public. The orchestra was, of course, that of the
New York Symphony Society, and my father infused the
entire ensemble with such an ideal of perfection that
during many of the performances, especially in “Lohengrin,”
“Le Prophète,” “Fidelio,” and “Walküre,” the
public seethed with excitement and enthusiasm. There
had been an “improvised” performance of “Walküre”
at the Academy of Music under the German conductor
Neuendorf a few years before. The <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> had been
sung by Madame Pappenheim, possessor of a glorious
voice, but the rest of the cast had been woefully deficient.
Insufficient rehearsals and ignorance of the music of
Wagner on the part of the conductor had also prevented
this performance from making any impression or giving
any real idea of the beauties of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The performance under my father included Madame
Materna as <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>, who had created the rôle in Bayreuth
in ’76 and who was then at the very height of her
glorious vocal powers; Madame Seidl-Kraus, an exquisite
and pathetic <span class='it'>Sieglinde</span>; Anton Schott, a vigorous and
highly dramatic <span class='it'>Siegmund</span>; and Staudigl as <span class='it'>Wotan</span>.
Staudigl was a son of the famous old Viennese bass with
whom he had studied, singing with such good results that
he made as fine an impression in concert and oratorio as
in opera. The first barytone was Adolf Robinson, who
had begun his career with my father in Breslau and whose
warm impassioned <span class='it'>bel canto</span> won instant recognition here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no professional opera claque at the Metropolitan
in those days such as is now maintained by some
of the singers and conductors who, in rivalry with each
other, foolishly spend their money in the hiring of twenty
to fifty husky men, under a well-trained leader, who stand
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
at the side of the balconies and family circle and clap
with the machine-like regularity of a steel hammer in an
iron foundry in order to produce so and so many recalls
after an act. In those days this was not necessary.
The public applauded wildly and shouted themselves
hoarse of their own free will, and the papers almost unanimously
pronounced the performances an artistic revolution,
and said that such dramatic truth and ensemble work
had but seldom before been presented in such a convincing
way on the operatic stage of New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the entire winter I lived in a sea of excitement
and of joy at seeing my father’s genius at last so universally
recognized. But my anxiety was also very great.
I was with him constantly, from morning until night, and
could see that the labor of carrying everything entirely
on his shoulders, the effort of organizing an artistic whole
out of the many different elements, was overwhelming.
The rehearsals often lasted all day and I do not think
that I missed a rehearsal or a performance during the
entire season. Sometimes I would timidly implore my
father to put some of the work, especially the managerial
part, on other shoulders, but he would not listen, saying
that the responsibility was his and that he could not delegate
what he conceived to be his solemn duty as one
representing German art in a foreign country to any one
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, the directors, after deliberating on
their future course, decided that opera in German had
come to stay and offered my father a contract for the
following year in which, however, with what they conceived
to be real business methods, they reduced his
salary to eight thousand dollars but offered him a share
in any possible profits. Money matters were to my father
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
always so unimportant as far as he was concerned, that
I think he would have signed a contract in which he bound
himself to pay eight thousand dollars a year to the Metropolitan
Opera House for the privilege of maintaining
Wagnerian opera there. He accepted their proposition
and was happy in the evident security of opera in German
for many years to come. During this winter he would
not give up his beloved Symphony and Oratorio Societies,
and he always insisted that the weekly Thursday-evening
rehearsals with the chorus of the Oratorio Society were
a rest for him from operatic affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During one of these rehearsals in February 1885 (I
think we were preparing the “Requiem” of Verdi)
he suddenly complained of feeling ill and I rushed
from the piano toward him, and together with some of
the singers we carried him to a cab and brought him
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pneumonia set in and he was too worn with the gigantic
struggles of the winter to withstand it. During this
terrible week of illness the opera had to be kept going and I
conducted “Walküre” and “Tannhäuser” without much
difficulty. They had been so splendidly rehearsed by
my father and had been performed several times; I knew
them by heart, and artists, chorus, and orchestra gave me
the most affectionate and willing assistance. I have
therefore never claimed much credit for what many kind
friends at that time considered an extraordinary feat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The season had only one more week to run, but my
father had made arrangements for a short tour comprising
Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On February 15 he died and left me numb and overwhelmed
by the terrible responsibilities which began to
press in upon me. Even at this late date I cannot bear
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
to write of my loss. Our relations had become so close
and intimate, and during the last years he had so often
leaned on me with such sweet confidence. I had always
looked up to him as my ideal of a man and musician, and
it seemed to me that I could never smile again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last performances at the Metropolitan immediately
after his death were conducted by John Lund, a highly
talented chorus master who has since made his home in
America, but there were so many immediate necessities
crowding in upon me that I had no opportunity for indulging
in quiet grief. Events moved with incredible
and terrible swiftness. The contracts for the tour had
to be met. My father’s estate was technically liable,
although he left literally no money. There was no one to
assume the responsibility of taking the company on tour
except poor me, and I accordingly set forth, together
with the entire company of about a hundred and fifty
members, on a special train of the West Shore Railroad
for Chicago on Saturday afternoon of February 21. We
were to open with “Tannhäuser” at the Columbia Theatre
on the following Monday evening. During this trip the
worst blizzard of the year struck our train. We were
completely snowed in and the road, which was at that
time a rather lame rival of the New York Central, was so
ill-equipped with means to shovel us out that instead of
arriving on Sunday evening, we did not get into Chicago
until Monday at eight P. M., the hour at which the performance
was to have begun. My dear brother Frank,
who had come on from Denver to meet me in Chicago
and to discuss future plans, boarded our train a little
while out of Chicago and told me that not only was the
house sold out, but all had determined to wait until we
arrived and chivalrously to “see us through.” The
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
mayor of the city had made an excited speech from the
proscenium box in which he was sitting and said that
Chicago must help a young man like myself who had so
courageously undertaken to carry on the great work of
his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we arrived at the station the company were
quickly bundled into cabs and omnibuses. Luckily the
scenery had been sent on ahead, but the costume and
property trunks were on our train, and the work of transferring
them and getting out the “Tannhäuser” costumes
and properties was agonizing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Materna and I were the first to arrive at the theatre,
and we were marched through the auditorium from the
front entrance by the local manager who wished to give
this ocular demonstration of our presence. The audience
cheered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the scenes the confusion was incredible. The
trunks with the wigs could not be found, nor the trunks
with the footwear, and <span class='it'>Tannhäuser</span> and the other singers
of the Wartburg, together with the noble lords and ladies,
appeared on the stage in a most remarkable combination
of costumes, mediæval and modern. But it made no
difference. I began the overture after ten o’clock. The
audience cheered themselves hoarse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trunk containing Materna’s costume as <span class='it'>Elizabeth</span>
was not hurled on the stage until just before the beginning
of the second act. It made no difference. When she
appeared in all her smiling radiance and sang “Dich
Theure Halle” the audience again went mad with delight,
and so on until the curtain finally fell at one-thirty in the
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since that terrible but wonderful evening I have
had a soft spot in my heart for Chicago, and during the
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
many years I have never lost the friendship of that remarkable
city. Even to-day, every now and then, an
old gray-headed or bald-headed citizen of Chicago comes
to me and says: “Do you remember that first performance
of ‘Tannhäuser’ at the Columbia Theatre in February,
1885?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success was so great that we extended our season
an extra week, during which I produced for the first time
“La Dame Blanche” by Boieldieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We finished our tour with a week in Boston, where we
had a similarly enthusiastic reception, and especially
“Walküre” and “Lohengrin” made a profound impression.
There I produced (for the first time in America,
I think) Gluck’s “Orpheus,” in which Marianne Brandt
gave a glorious and touching impersonation of the title-rôle.
It is characteristic of the audacity of youth that I
should have given two new performances of operas which
were rehearsed and produced while we were on tour,
“La Dame Blanche” and “Orpheus.” But as the principal
rôles had been sung by most of our artists in Germany,
these two operas being in the regular repertoire
of every German opera-house, the feat was not so extraordinary.
The performances were good in ensemble and
gave great pleasure to the audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My farewell performance in Boston was a Saturday
matinée of the “Walküre” with Materna as <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>.
In the morning the orchestra struck. We had made
arrangements to send the entire company to New York
on one of the large Fall River steamers, but they vowed
that they would not go by steamer and insisted on being
sent by train. I was equally determined to send them by
water. The steamers were palatial, the weather excellent
spring weather, and there was no valid reason for objecting.
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
When they persisted in their demands I told them
that I would consider them as having broken their contracts,
that I would not pay them their salaries for the
week, and would give the “Walküre” performance accompanied
on two pianos, by John Lund and myself.
This was, of course, a crazy bluff, but it worked and they
decided to accept passage by steamer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the third act of “Walküre,” when
Materna as <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> had snuggled into the artificially
deep hollow of the rocky couch which sustained her
bulky form and on which she was to begin her slumber of
years until the hero, <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>, should awaken her, and
when Staudigl (<span class='it'>Wotan</span>) had disappeared in the flames, I
suddenly noticed, while conducting the beautiful monotony
of the last E-major chords of the Fire Charm, that the
grass mats just below <span class='it'>Brunhilde’s</span> couch had caught fire,
and that just as the curtain was descending slowly on the
last bars a Boston fireman with helmet on his head and
bucket in his hand quietly came out from the wings and
poured a liberal dose of water on the flames. The thing
happened so late and so quickly that there was no panic.
The people went mad with enthusiasm and Materna,
Staudigl, and I had to bow our farewells many, many
times. Just after one of these recalls I noted the little
fireman standing in the wings and saying: “Be jabbers, I
ought to come out too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you should,” I said, and with that took him by
one hand and Materna by the other and thus we dragged
him before the footlights where, with true Hibernian sense
of humor, he bowed right and left with a delighted grin
on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended my first opera tour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While I was on tour the directors of the Metropolitan
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
Opera House met to consider their future policy, and, in
view of the success of the opera in German inaugurated
by my father, they decided to continue on the same lines.
Curiously enough they appointed a young man as director
of the opera who had never had any managerial or musical
experience in his life. His name was Edmund C.
Stanton. He was a relative of one of the directors and
had acted as recording secretary for the Board of Directors.
He was tall, good-looking, with gentle brown eyes,
always well groomed, of a kindly disposition and the most
perfect and courtly manners which indeed never failed
him and which were about all that he had left at the end
of his seven years’ incumbency, at which time the German
opera crumbled to dust as a natural result of his curious
ignorance and incompetency in matters operatic. The
directors at the same time very generously appointed me
as his assistant and as second conductor, granting me a
salary which was large enough to enable me to support
my mother and my father’s family decently. This was
naturally a great relief to me and I determined to strain
every nerve to show myself worthy of such confidence
and generosity.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span><h1>VII</h1></div>

<h3>LILLI LEHMANN</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1885 I was to accompany Mr. Stanton
as assistant director and musical adviser to engage singers
for the following season of German opera at the Metropolitan
Opera House, but as Mr. Stanton’s little daughter
became ill and subsequently died, I went over alone and
have always been quite proud of the four contracts I
had ready for Stanton’s signature when he, a month
later, arrived in Germany. These were Lilli Lehmann,
soprano from the Royal Opera House in Berlin; Emil
Fischer, bass from the Royal Opera House in Dresden;
Max Alvary, lyric tenor from Weimar, and Anton Seidl,
conductor of the Angelo Neumann Wagner Opera Company.
These four artists became subsequently the mainstay
of the German opera and in America developed to
greater and greater power and fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lilli Lehmann, at that time forty years of age, had
sung principally the coloratura rôles, and with these had
made a great local reputation throughout Germany and
Austria. She had sung the <span class='it'>First Rhine Maiden</span> at
Bayreuth in 1876, and an occasional <span class='it'>Elsa</span> in “Lohengrin,”
but it was not until she came to America that she began
to sing the <span class='it'>Brunhildes</span> and <span class='it'>Isoldes</span> which made her one of
the greatest dramatic sopranos of her time. Curiously
enough, she insisted on making her first appearance in
America as <span class='it'>Carmen</span>, a rôle to which she gave a dramatic,
tragic, and rather sombre significance, but in which the
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
lighter, coquettish touches were perhaps not sufficiently
emphasized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had achieved her pre-eminence as a dramatic
soprano only after years of the hardest kind of work,
and had only through her indomitable will and energy
changed her voice from a light coloratura to a dramatic
soprano, and as I was at that period only twenty-three
and already occupied a position of considerable responsibility,
it took some time before she was ready to concede
that I was really a musician of serious purpose who was
working day and night to fit myself for the various responsibilities
so suddenly thrust upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Conducting is an art with a technic of its own, and
good musicianship alone is not sufficient. During a performance
the conductor must know how to make his
singers and players convey his interpretation, and to do
this, a glance of the eye and many different movements
of hands and head have to speak a language of their own
which his executants must quickly understand and follow.
The conductor must also know when and how to
follow a soloist with sympathy. This technic cannot
be acquired overnight, and I owe to Lilli Lehmann a
valuable hint in this connection. As Anton Seidl was the
accredited and celebrated Wagner conductor, these operas
and any other novelties of importance naturally fell to
him, and it remained for me to conduct only such operas
as he did not care to assume—Meyerbeer’s “Le Prophète,”
Verdi’s “Trovatore,” etc., etc. This caused me
great sorrow and anguish of heart, as a great part of my
training had been in the modern operas. I almost knew
the Wagner music-dramas by heart and had received a
very thorough training in the symphonies of the classic
composers, but for the operas of Meyerbeer and Verdi,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
I had a youthful intolerance, and of their traditions of
tempi and nuance I knew but little, with the exception,
perhaps, of Meyerbeer’s “Le Prophète,” which had been
marvellously performed under my father the preceding
year and in which Marianne Brandt had sung the part
of the mother with incredible pathos and nobility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, while I was rehearsing “La Juive,” of Halévy,
Lilli Lehmann turned on me during the intermission and
said: “Walter, in those old operas you do not watch the
singers enough, you are occupied with the orchestra as if
you were conducting a symphony. You give them the
cue for their entrances and you look at them instead of
at your singers. We need you and you need us. The
orchestra have their printed parts before them; we sing
by heart and have to rely on the conductor for difficult
entrances. Watch my lips when I sing, and you will
know when I breathe and you will breathe with me; you
will immediately also sense the <span class='it'>tempo rubato</span> which is such
an important part in the proper phrasing of these older
operas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This advice was a revelation to me, and I found to my
delight that by heeding it, not only was I able to follow
the singers with the orchestra, but even to influence the
singers in regard to tempi. At the performance of “La
Juive” I must have stared at Lilli like a Cheshire cat
whenever she was singing. The music went with remarkable
unanimity and elasticity, and at the close of
the performance Lilli, who was never very profuse in
praise, turned to me and said: “You see, Walter, how well
it goes. What did I tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, slowly and often painfully, I strengthened
my grasp of the technic of my craft, and with increased
assurance on my part came an increased compliance on the
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
part of the singers to follow my artistic desires as regards
the interpretation of their rôles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the operas that I was permitted to conduct were
still only the left-overs from Anton Seidl’s richly laden
table, and he was naturally not willing to give up any of
his prerogatives to a man so much younger. My first
real opportunity came in the year 1890, when Seidl was
to conduct an exquisite opera by Peter Cornelius, “The
Barber of Baghdad.” Paul Kalisch, Lilli Lehmann’s
husband, was to sing <span class='it'>Nureddin</span> and Emil Fischer the
loquacious Barber. Cornelius had been a devoted and
close friend of my father and mother in the old Weimar
days under Liszt. Liszt had produced this opera in
Weimar in those days, but the Weimar public had rejected
it because of what they considered to be its ultramodern
tendencies, and because of this, Liszt had resigned
his position of Grand Ducal Kapellmeister. I was naturally
much interested in our New York production. I
had attended almost every rehearsal and had revelled in
the exquisite beauties and humor of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days before the performance, Seidl became dangerously
ill and I was in a fever of uncertainty whether
Stanton would postpone the performance or let me conduct
it. I found that Lilli Lehmann protested loudly
that it would be impossible for me to conduct this work,
that it was too difficult and too intricate, and that it
needed a conductor of many years’ experience and plenty
of rehearsals at that. But I seemed to have “good friends
at court” and it was decided that I should conduct the
general rehearsal that morning for which singers, chorus,
and orchestra had been hastily called together, and if all
went well I was to conduct the performance. As I walked
into the orchestra pit I could see Lilli Lehmann seated
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
all by herself a few rows back, looking at me with what
seemed to me baleful and threatening eyes. But as I
turned my back on her and gave the signal for the overture,
my apprehension left me and I gave myself up
completely to the music. The curtain rose and Kalisch
began <span class='it'>Nureddin’s</span> lovely song together with his attendants
on awakening from his long illness to renewed health
and with renewed longings for his beloved <span class='it'>Margiana</span>.
Everything went as if on wings and at the end of the
act I saw, to my delight, among the singers who were
rushing toward me with affectionate congratulations,
Lilli, the stately, telling me that she had not believed it
possible, but was now convinced that I had a thorough
grasp of the music and could conduct it successfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The performance the next day went even better than
the rehearsal, and I date from this my entry as a full-fledged
opera conductor, and my relations with Lilli
Lehmann became artistically more and more fraternal
and personally more and more friendly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1897-98 I engaged her to sing <span class='it'>Isolde</span> and the <span class='it'>Brunhildes</span>
in my Damrosch Opera Company and paid her a
thousand dollars a night and all hotel and travelling
expenses for two people (her sister Marie travelled with
her), and she also insisted that I must pay her laundry
bills. But I found that this remarkable woman, having
established her right to these perquisites by contract,
refused to abuse them, and when she found that I paid
quite a large figure for her “parlor, bedroom, and bath”
at the Normandie Hotel near the Metropolitan, she was
furious; and, saying that she did not see why these rascally
hotel proprietors should be enriched by me, she moved to
a much cheaper suite at the top of the hotel and she and
her sister did a great deal of their laundry in their own
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
bathroom, partly because she wished to save me the
expense, and also because she insisted that all American
laundries ruined delicate lingerie. Incidentally the elevator
boys insisted that she never tipped them, and I sent
my manager to her hotel to do this, as otherwise she
would not have received adequate service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much has been written about her marvellous portrayal
of the heroic figures in the Wagner music-dramas
that it is hardly necessary for me to add anything to the
general chorus of admiration, but I wish to emphasize
the fact that by far the greater part of the credit belongs
to her for her indomitable will and perseverance, as
nature had not given her originally a dramatic voice.
It was a wonderfully clear and high coloratura soprano,
but by persistent practice she developed an ample middle
and lower register and made it equal to the emotional
demands of an <span class='it'>Isolde</span> or a <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her acting was majestic, but in the first act of “Tristan”
and in the second act of “Götterdämmerung” her
anger was like forked flashes of lightning. I suppose that
her technic of acting would be called old-fashioned to-day,
as those were the days of statuesque poses, often
maintained without changes for long stretches at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the forenoon of the days that she had to sing <span class='it'>Isolde</span>
she always sang through the entire rôle in her rooms with
full voice, just to make sure that she could do it in the
evening. Compare this to those delicate prima donnas
who, on the days when they have to sing, often speak only
in whispers in order that their precious vocal cords may
not be affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having achieved so much through her own energy and
triumphed over so many obstacles, she thought that she
could similarly transform her husband, Paul Kalisch,
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
from a lyric to a dramatic tenor. How she worked and
harassed that poor man! She certainly was the stronger
of the two, and while his entire inclination was toward
easy and delightful companionship with others of similar
inclinations, she forced him to study and to sing for hours
at a stretch, but with only partial success as far as his
transformation into a real dramatic and “heroic” Wagner
tenor was concerned. It simply was not in his nature to
become “heroic,” and when, as sometimes happened, he
committed some blunder, some false entrance while singing
<span class='it'>Siegfried</span> in the “Götterdämmerung,” the glances
which <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> cast upon him on the stage were so
terrible, so pregnant with punishment to come, that
from my conductor’s stand I used to pity the poor man
thus compelled to swim around in a pond which was so
much larger than he wanted; and often after such a
performance I would find him moodily seated all alone
at a table in the restaurant of the hotel with a pint bottle
of champagne before him and with no desire to go upstairs
and face the anger of his <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> spouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tragic but rather amusing occurrence in Pittsburgh
should here be recorded. The Damrosch Opera Company
was playing a week there at the Alvin Theatre. On the
night in question we were to give “Götterdämmerung”
with Lilli Lehmann as <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>. All was well. No
singers had sent ominous messages of illness during the
day, and I had just sat down to a quiet dinner at the
Duquesne Club, previous to the performance, when a
telephone summoned me. It was my wardrobe mistress,
Frau Engelhardt, an excellent woman, devoted to her
work, who had been at the Metropolitan in the old German
opera days and who had been with me ever since the
founding of the Damrosch Opera Company. She implored
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
me to come to the theatre immediately as something
dreadful had happened. I of course left my dinner
with but faint hope of eating it later on, arrived at the
theatre and found the stage silent as the grave, the scene
set for the first act of “Götterdämmerung” and seemingly
no one there but Frau Engelhardt, who in greatest agitation
begged me to come immediately to Madame Lehmann’s
dressing-room, where the “something dreadful
had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knocked at her door and heard a tragic and hollow
voice call “come in,” and as I opened the door a sight
indeed terrible met my astonished gaze. There stood
Lilli Lehmann, already apparelled in her white <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>
garb, but covered from head to foot with soot, so
black that she seemed more fit for a minstrel show than
a Wagner music-drama. Her face was covered with
black streaks, especially where her tears had made long
and terrible furrows down her cheeks. I could not
imagine what had happened, and only gradually and between
hysterical bursts of tears, I learned that Lilli,
according to her custom, had gone to the theatre hours
before the performance and had proceeded to dress herself,
only looking into the glass at the last moment to
prepare her make-up. She had then discovered the
terrible condition of her face and costume. It seemed
that the janitor had given the heater in the cellar a special
raking which had sent tons of this dreadful Pittsburgh
soft-coal soot flying through the registers and into the
dressing-rooms where it settled like a pall on everything
within reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lilli vowed that it was absolutely impossible for her
to sing that night and I was in despair. It suddenly
came to me that if I could divert her mind in some way
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
the tension might be eased, and I therefore turned on
poor trembling Frau Engelhardt and told her in as angry
tones as I could dramatically summon, that she was discharged,
that it was her duty to take care of my artists,
and to allow such an outrage to happen to the greatest
of all of them was something which I could not understand
or forgive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as I denounced our wardrobe mistress in this
manner, Lilli pricked up her ears and remonstrated with
me at my injustice. She insisted that it was not Frau
Engelhardt’s fault and that it was very wrong of me to
discharge her. It showed that I had no heart and she
for one would never hold her responsible for such an
occurrence. Slowly I allowed myself to be persuaded
and at the psychological moment gently left the dressing-room,
giving Frau Engelhardt a comprehensive glance
which she understood. I knew that the two women together
would soon set matters to right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the dressing-room I found my faithful Hans,
son of my prompter, Goettich. I gave him some money
and told him to run to a florist and buy a bunch of the
whitest flowers that he could find and to bring them to
Madame Lehmann with my compliments. I then returned
to the club and finished my dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I got back to the theatre just before the performance,
I found Lilli already on the stage, newly attired
in clean white robes, but as she turned toward me I
could still discern darkish streaks beneath the make-up
of her cheeks, and in her sombre, dramatic voice she
said: “Walter, I thank you for the lovely white flowers,
but they will never, never wash me clean again.” Her
singing that night seemed to me more glorious than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Pittsburgh we went to New York, where I had
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
arranged with Abbey and Grau to give me the Metropolitan
Opera House for a short season of three weeks.
As I wanted a special attraction for New York, I engaged
Madame Nordica for a few “Lohengrin” performances in
which she was to sing <span class='it'>Elsa</span>, and Lilli Lehmann, <span class='it'>Ortrude</span>,
a part that she had never sung in New York, but whose
dramatic possibilities interested her very much and for
which she was eminently suited. At first she was furious
that I had engaged any other singer for New York.
“If I was sufficient to carry on your season out of town, I
do not see why you have to engage that —— for New
York.” But I explained to her my managerial reasons
and somewhat pacified her, and as soon as we arrived in
New York I arranged for a little rehearsal on the stage of
the Metropolitan for Lehmann, Nordica, and myself,
in order that all the scenes, especially of the second act,
in which their acting together was of importance, might
be properly arranged. At this rehearsal Lehmann treated
Nordica with icy disdain, but Nordica acted with such
clever tact and deference that Lehmann could find no
hook upon which to hang her anger, and the rehearsal
passed off with outward calmness, although I could feel
the volcano trembling beneath. As we passed out into
the street in the late afternoon a terrible rain-storm was
raging and Lilli saw Madame Nordica approach a coachman
in livery who was waiting with opened umbrella to
take her to her coupé. Lilli, clad in a long gray rain-coat
and old hat, turned to Nordica: “Ha, you ride? I valk!”
she said, as she lifted her dress and showed a pair of
great boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidentally my “showman’s instinct” had proved
correct. Our performances of “Lohengrin” with this
combination proved artistically very interesting and the
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
public flocked to hear them. Nordica’s <span class='it'>Elsa</span> had been
very carefully trained at Bayreuth, and Lehmann’s
<span class='it'>Ortrude</span> was truly demoniac, worthy to rank with that of
Marianne Brandt’s in its representation of concentrated
hatred.</p>

<h3>HANS VON BÜLOW</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In 1856 my father and Hans von Bülow, pianist, were
struggling to gain recognition and a livelihood in Berlin.
Both were idealists and enthusiastic followers of the
“new school” in music, of which Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner
were the great representatives. Bülow’s letters of
that period show that they gave many chamber-music
concerts together, both in Berlin and elsewhere, and it is
interesting to note that at one of them, together with
the violoncellist, Kossman, they performed a trio by
“César Franck of Liège,” about thirty years before this
father of the modern French school of composition became
generally known and recognized. It was through
Bülow that my father and his achievements as a violin
virtuoso and composer became known to Liszt, who
invited him, in 1857, to become violinist at the first
desk of the Weimar Opera Orchestra, then under Liszt’s
direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friendship between Bülow and my father remained
intimate and fine during my father’s entire life, and even
beyond, as this chapter will show.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first recollection of Bülow goes back to 1876, when
he came to America at the invitation of the Chickering
Piano firm to inaugurate their new Chickering Hall on
Fifth Avenue and 19th Street, and to give piano recitals
all over the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my father and mother went to Berlin in the
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
sixties for a joint concert with Bülow, they stayed with
him and his wife, Cosima. Since then much had happened.
Cosima had run away with Wagner, Bülow’s
most adored friend, and Bülow had nearly died with the
shame and misery of it. One evening during dinner at
our house my mother asked him about his children, whom
she had not seen since those early days, and I can still
hear the punctilious courtesy with which he answered:
“They are where they should be, and in the best possible
hands—with their mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine intellectuality of his playing, the quality of
his phrasing, especially in Bach and Beethoven, created
a deep impression on our public which was not minimized
by certain eccentricities in his appearance and behavior.
He always appeared on the stage for his afternoon recitals
attired in the traditional black double-breasted frock coat
and very light-gray trousers, his hands incased in
light-brown gloves and holding a high silk hat which was
carefully deposited under the piano before he took off his
gloves and began to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one of his recitals a young and highly talented
soprano, Miss Emma Thursby, had been engaged. She
was a protégée of old Maurice Strakosch, an impresario
of the old school, shrewd, polished in his manners, who
very cleverly advertised the high personal character of
the young singer and especially her great “purity,” vowing
that acquaintance with her, hardened old sinner
that he was, had made him a better man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Bülow recital her singing of some German songs
by Schubert and Schumann, I think, was received with
such enthusiastic applause that she gave an encore, a
rather trivial song by Franz Abt. When Bülow, in his
dressing-room, heard this “desecration” of a programme
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
composed of works of great masters only, his rage knew
no bounds, and when he came out on the stage to continue
his own programme, he deliberately took out his
handkerchief and carefully wiped the keys of the piano
up and down in a noisy glissando scale and then began to
improvise on the recitative from Beethoven’s Ninth
Symphony, “O friends, not these tones.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another time he gave a chamber-music concert with
my father and they played, among other things, the
“Kreutzer Sonata” of Beethoven. Just before going
on the stage he turned to my father and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us play it by heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With pleasure,” answered my father and laid down
his music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” said Bülow, “take it on the stage with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had taken their places on the stage Bülow
ostentatiously rose, took my father’s music from the
stand and his own from the piano and laid them both
under the piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His memory, not only for music, but for all things that
interested him, was prodigious and to me uncanny. But
it was, after all, human and not infallible, and on this
occasion he did lose his place in the last movement of the
sonata and my father had to improvise with him for a few
bars until, with quick ingenuity, he found the thread
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have spoken elsewhere of the terrible responsibilities
which were placed upon my shoulders because of the sudden
death of my father, and as the years went by I
seemed to miss him more and more, not only his wonderful
companionship, but the wise counsel with which he used
to help me solve my musical riddles. I worked hard and
made progress, I think, for my circle of friends and followers
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
grew larger and larger. But I knew no one in this
country to whom I could turn in the same way as to my
father, or who would have given me of his wisdom so
freely and generously as he. Seidl, my associate at the
Metropolitan, was not friendly and was completely
wrapped up in himself, and besides, he had, to my thinking,
only one specialty, the Wagner music-dramas. As
a symphonic conductor he was completely without experience
when he first came to America and his interpretation
of the classics lacked foundation and real penetration,
in spite of the noisy acclaim which a certain part
of our public gave him because of his undoubted genius
as a Wagner conductor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lucky chance brought me a clipping from a German
newspaper announcing that Hans von Bülow would
spend the summer of 1887 in Frankfort, where he would
teach a class of advanced pianists and devote the entire
receipts toward building a monument to his old friend,
Joachim Raff, who had spent his last years in Frankfort
as director of the conservatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I immediately determined to go to Germany and ask
Bülow if, in view of his old friendship with my father and
my need of the help of some great musician, he would be
willing to let me study with him the interpretation of the
Beethoven Symphonies in especial, and such other works
as it would interest him to analyze for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow was at that time considered the foremost conductor
of Germany. He had taken a little mediocre
orchestra of fifty, belonging to the Grand Duke of Meiningen,
and through his supreme genius had galvanized
it into a marvellous instrument. Under his guidance this
little orchestra had created a sensation all over Germany
and Austria and a special <span class='it'>tour de force</span> was their playing
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
of certain symphonies entirely by heart without any
music before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I arrived in Frankfort I found that Bülow was
living at the Schwan Hotel, and with much trepidation I
told him what I wanted of him. He seemed very much
touched and claimed that it was the first time in his experience
that a musician who, as he put it, “was already
prominent in opera, symphony, and oratorio” thought
he could learn anything from him. In the warmest, I
may say most affectionate terms, he promised me every
possible help and advised me to take rooms in the same
hotel. This I did, and I can truthfully say that the
entire summer during which I was with him in closest
companionship, not only in his rooms and during the
lesson hours for the pianists, many of which I also attended,
but on long walks to the museums, the parks,
and the suburbs of Frankfort, his almost paternal kindliness,
his wisdom, and his comments on things artistic,
literary, political, and personal were a revelation to me.
So many stories were current about his biting comments
and brusque behavior toward people who excited his
enmity, that I was amazed to find him throughout so
companionable and so gentle in all his relations toward
me. He had a heart most tender and sensitive, but
life had dealt this idealist so many hard knocks that he
incased his heart in a shell with which to protect it from
further onslaughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went through all Beethoven’s nine symphonies
with me, bar by bar, phrase by phrase, and I still have
the scores in which he made certain notations of phrasing
or illustrated changes in dynamics of certain instruments
in order to bring out the undoubted intentions of
Beethoven more clearly. He virtually analyzed the symphonies
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
for me in the same way as in his edition of the
piano sonatas, and at the close of our three months together
he gave me a copy of his own score of the Ninth
Symphony with all his own annotations, many of which
were based on the analysis made by Wagner during his
historic performance of that work at the corner-stone
laying of the Bayreuth Fest-Spielhaus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these three months of intensive study I received
so much from him that was new to me, such a
wealth of ideas regarding interpretation and the technic
of the conductor’s art, that it took me years to digest
it properly and to learn how, instead of merely copying
slavishly, I could make it my own and accept or reject
parts of it, according to the methods of analysis
taught me by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During our stay in Frankfort a little Prince of Hesse,
whose mother, the Landgravine, was a “Royal Highness,”
being a niece of the old Emperor William, invited von
Bülow to give a Brahms recital at his palace. Bülow
immediately insisted that I, too, must be invited, which
accordingly I was. When I accompanied him he introduced
me to the various exalted personages assembled,
and the Landgravine asked me if I were not “the son of
the great Doctor Damrosch.” I politely answered:
“Yes, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he not a friend of Rubinstein?” she continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He played the viola, did he not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said: “No, your Royal Highness, the violin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, “the viola.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This taught me that royalty must never be contradicted,
even if they know “facts” about your own father
of which you are not aware.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
The Prince of Hesse was blind and thought he had a
gift for music, in fact he “composed” string quartets
which, I presume, he more or less “dictated” to the court
musician of his little princely household.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before the supper the Prince came up to Bülow
with a huge laurel wreath, which enraged Bülow very
much. He always called them “vegetables of Fame,”
and he immediately shouted: “Is there no bust of Brahms
here?” but as there was none, he laid the wreath on the
piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the very good supper which was served to their
Royal Highnesses and von Bülow in one room and to the
other guests in another, I found to my amazement that
the blind Prince was led to my chair holding a champagne
glass in his hand with which to toast me specially, “the
American musician and conductor,” and two days later
the Prince and his gentleman in waiting formally called
on me at my hotel. An hour later the gentleman in
waiting returned to inform me that the Prince would
like to have me accept the position of musician in his
household with “twelve hundred Thalers a year and free
board at the palace.” I had to explain to him ever so
politely and gratefully that I was then conductor at the
Metropolitan Opera House, the New York Symphony
Society, and the New York Oratorio Society, and that
with high appreciation of this offer, I could not possibly
give up these positions and my American career to come
to Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow, when I told him of it, burst into loud guffaws
of delighted laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow was in wretched health during the entire summer,
suffering from headaches, sleeplessness, and general
nervous collapse, but with an iron will he went through
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
the summer’s programme, accepting no financial recompense
for himself, solely to help gather money through his
classes toward the completion of the Raff monument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember one night returning to the hotel after the
opera, and as I passed the door of his room to get to mine,
which was on the same floor, I heard such loud and continued
sobbing that I opened his door, after receiving no
response to my knocking. I found him in his nightclothes,
kneeling before his bed, his head buried in the
mattress and sobbing so bitterly that it was heart-breaking.
I rushed over to him, thinking that perhaps
he was very ill, and it was a long time before I could quiet
him. He kept reiterating that life was over for him,
that he wanted to die, and it was only by continually
telling him how much we all adored him and what his
friendship meant for us that I was able gradually to
quiet him and to put him to bed, where I sat holding
his hands until early morning when he finally went to
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weak and ill though he was after the summer’s arduous
work, he had promised the University of Marburg
to give them two of his famous Beethoven recitals, and
as his friend Steyl, the music publisher, and I were worried
about his condition we decided to accompany him
in order to look after him. The arrangements for the
concerts which were to be held in the afternoon in the
aula of the venerable university were in the hands of
the professor of Greek, a typical old absent-minded gentleman
who seemed overcome with the honor of having a
visit from the great von Bülow and who also was nervously
afraid of this brusque little man. I was worried over
the whole affair. Bülow had been very weak all morning
and Steyl and I wanted him to cancel the recital, but he
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
would not hear of it and bravely went on the stage to
begin his programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, owing to the summer heat, the windows
of the aula were open wide, and during the music the cries
of the children playing below, the rumbling of carts over
the rough pavements of the mediæval streets, came up
in constant clangor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow began, faltered, began again and stopped—ran
from the stage and returned to begin again. But it was
no use. The noise continued and the recital had to be
called off, and after a nervous crisis accompanied by
great weeping, we got him back to the hotel and to bed,
Bülow heaping curses on the little professor on whom he
blamed everything, the glaring sunlight, the cries of the
playing children, and the noise of the carts. The recital
for the following day was, of course, cancelled, and we
arranged everything for taking Bülow back to Frankfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning when I called at his rooms I found him
punctiliously attired in his frock coat, high silk hat, and
brown glacé gloves, and in answer to my evidently astonished
gaze, he said: “We must not leave without paying
our farewell call of ceremony on the Greek professor.”
I trembled at the outcome, but a carriage with two horses
and a liveried coachman was already waiting in the courtyard
of the hotel to take us up the hill to the old mediæval
tower of the university in which the professor lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were ushered into a wonderful circular library, the
books covering the entire inner wall of the tower, and
while we were waiting for the professor, Bülow ran
around the room like a dog on the scent, examining the
titles of the various books on the shelves. Suddenly he
pounced on one, pulled it out and began to turn the leaves
quickly until he got to a certain page at which he held
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
the book open just as the old professor entered, trembling
from head to foot. I was rather apprehensive of the
meeting between the two men, but to my astonishment,
Bülow advanced, book in hand, and with a low bow
handed it silently to the gentle amateur impresario,
pointing to a certain place on the opened page. The professor
read it, blushed, and looked with a kind of dumb
apology at von Bülow, who then took up his hat and,
with another low bow, left the room, followed by me, still
completely mystified by this silent ceremonial, the meaning
of which I could not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the drive back to the hotel, Bülow chirped up
considerably. Now and then he chuckled and finally,
as if the joke were too good to keep, he turned toward
me and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what quotation I gave to the Greek
professor? It was from one of the Greek philosophers
to the effect that ‘it is not wise for a man of learning to
mix himself up in the practical affairs of life.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps some learned reader of this may be able to tell
me who the Greek author was. Bülow never told me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On our long walks Bülow would often reminisce about
the past and would tell me enough stories to fill a book.
Two of them I shall tell here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow was spending a winter in Florence and was
invited to conduct a performance of Beethoven’s Ninth
Symphony with the local orchestra. In those days
Italy had literally no symphonic orchestras, and the players,
recruited from the opera-houses, had but little routine
for concert music of symphonic importance. The men
were willing and eager, but even such a routined conductor
as Bülow found it difficult to make them understand
certain rhythmic subtleties in this most intricate of all
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
Beethoven’s works. In the scherzo there comes a place
where the kettledrum has to enter rudely with a repetition
of the first bar of the main theme:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illo84.jpg' alt='' id='illo84' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>This rhythm the kettledrum player simply could not
grasp, no matter how patiently Bülow endeavored to
instill it. He tried it slow, he tried it fast. Bülow got
more and more excited and irritable, and finally, as a
last resort, he fairly shouted to him on the rhythm of this
theme the Italian word for kettledrum. At the top of
his voice rose the word:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.8em;'>“Tym—pan—y! Tym—pan—y!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A delighted smile broke over the face of the kettledrum
player.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, capisco, capisco,” he shouted, and immediately
proceeded to put his newly won knowledge to the practical
proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow told me that at one time he had adopted the
habit of jotting down any strange or incongruous names
that he found on the signs of shops in the various cities
of the various countries that he visited. In a small little
German town he found over a greengrocery, the name of
“Seidenschwanz.” This appealed to him and he tucked
it away in his memory, determined to find a given name to
add that would, by its very contrast, fit it. For months
he cudgelled his brains, but in vain, until one night in
Venice he jumped up from his bed, shouting: “I have it.
<span class='it'>Caligula Seidenschwanz!</span>” The name of the most cruel
of Roman Emperors coupled with that of the little greengrocer!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
Next morning he proceeded to an engraver and had
visiting cards printed bearing the mysterious name of:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='bbox'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:3em;margin-bottom:3em;font-style:italic;'>Caligula Seidenschwanz.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='noindent'>Shortly after, whenever Doctor Hans von Bülow paid a
call on any one, instead of presenting his own card, he
left that of Herr Seidenschwanz, thereby completely
mystifying his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told this story years after while dining at the house
of my dear friends, May Callender and Caro de Forest.
Lilli Lehmann was one of the guests, and when I finished
she jumped up and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walter, that is a very remarkable story, but it is absolutely true,
as I happen to know. I was coloratura soprano
at the Berlin Royal Opera at the time when Bülow
paid us a visit one night when we performed Meyerbeer’s
‘Prophète.’ He was so disgusted with the performance
that he wrote one of his indignant and cynical
letters to a Berlin paper, in which he compared the Royal
Opera to a circus, and then added insult to injury by
apologizing to Herr Renz, owner of the greatest circus in
Germany, saying that he meant no insult to him, as he
had always been a great admirer of the Circus Renz.
This letter aroused the old intendant, Baron von Hulsen,
to such fury that he forbade Bülow further entrance into
the opera-house and at the same time induced the old
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
Emperor to withdraw the title of ‘Pianist to His Majesty,
the King of Prussia’ from von Bülow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lilli Lehmann then continued to narrate that the
morning after the performance she received a large basket
of flowers in which a card had been tucked, on which was
written “To the only bright spot in yesterday’s performance.
In admiration, <span class='it'>Caligula Seidenschwanz</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until that evening, when I explained the origin of the
name, Lilli Lehmann had not known that the flowers had
been sent her by von Bülow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the summer session Bülow invited me to
go with him to the Cologne Musical Festival. He told
me that he had written to Brahms about me and wanted
me to meet him, and I would also hear a fine performance
of the Brahms “Requiem.” Needless to say I jumped
at such an opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father, who with that wonderful liberal attitude of
his did not share the narrow attitude of other Wagnerians
who hated Brahms, had been among the first to
introduce his music in America and had given the first
performance of the Brahms Symphony No. 1 in C minor
in America. Bülow had become a similar propagandist
for Brahms in Germany. I considered him the last
great composer of modern times, doubly interesting because
the great genius of Wagner, whom he admired
greatly, left him untouched as far as his own creative
work was concerned, and he is, perhaps, the only great
modern composer whose works can show no influence of
the Wagnerian school. To conduct his symphonies is to
me still one of the greatest joys of the winter, and I continue
to marvel how little the years have aged them and
how noble in conception and rich in subtleties of feeling
they continue to express in an unbroken line the highest
ideals of the Beethoven symphonies.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
In the hurly-burly of a festival, I had but little opportunity
to see much of Brahms, who was there only a very
few days, and I was too young and unimportant to claim
any attention from him; but I was grateful to Bülow
for the opportunity of meeting him, and can still see his
wonderful and kindly eye turned on me as Bülow told
him some nice things about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During our stay in Cologne I had an experience so
curious, so extraordinary, that I must especially assure
my readers that it is true in every particular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Bülow announced to me that he was going
to cross the river in the afternoon to visit the widow of
an old friend of his, Madame B——, who lived in a villa
in Deutz. He asked me to accompany him, and we accordingly
called on a rather attractive young widow, attired
in the deepest mourning, who welcomed us very
graciously. Her husband, a Belgian pianist of distinction,
had been professor of piano at the Imperial Conservatory
in St. Petersburg and had there married a young
Russian pupil of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After chatting awhile, she proposed that we go into
the garden for a cup of tea, and we followed her, accordingly,
to a small stone building in the middle of the garden
that looked like a chapel, but which, to my horror, I discovered,
as we entered, to be a mausoleum. In the centre
stood a sarcophagus on the top of which reposed a coffin,
with a glass top, in which lay the body of B——! A footman
in livery followed us with a samovar and the teacups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems that the lady had thus endeavored to demonstrate
her love for her departed husband. I confess that
I became almost ill and hurriedly left the mausoleum to
smell the roses in the garden, but Bülow punctiliously
and courageously stuck it out and had his cup of tea
under these unique conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
Many years after I heard through Mrs. Franz Rummel,
whose husband had been a favorite pupil of B——, that
his widow was again happily married and that B—— had
been properly buried underground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1889 I induced Mr. Leo Goldmark, brother of the
Viennese composer, who was interested in music and the
musical affairs of New York, to bring von Bülow to America
for another visit, and more especially to give his
Beethoven sonata cycle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bülow brought his second wife with him and the visit
was a great success in every way. She had been a young
actress of talent at the Meiningen Court Theatre and he
had married her while he was conductor of the orchestra
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Beethoven recitals were given at the Broadway
Theatre which was crowded to the doors, and press and
public greeted the old master with such friendly enthusiasm
that he was very much touched and became
very enthusiastic about America. He also conducted my
orchestra in a memorable concert at the Metropolitan
Opera House in which he demonstrated his marvellous
powers as a conductor. Among the works on the programme
was the “Tragic Overture” by Brahms. Just
before beginning the rehearsal of this he called out to
the orchestra librarian, Russell, by name: “Where is
the contrabassoon? Why is there no contrabassoon engaged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In vain were Russell’s protests that he had not been
told to engage a contrabassoon, but suddenly Bülow’s
anger subsided and he began the rehearsal. During it,
as was his custom, he conducted without any orchestral
score before him. His memory of what the individual
instruments had to play was indeed remarkable, although
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
I always felt that he enjoyed showing it off a little at rehearsals.
After the rehearsal was over he called Russell
to his side and, slipping him a five-dollar bill, whispered:
“Do not say anything; it was my mistake, there is no
contrabassoon in the Brahms Overture.”</p>

<h3>ANDREW CARNEGIE AND THE BLAINE FAMILY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1887 I sailed for Europe to spend the
summer in study with Hans von Bülow, and on the
steamer I met Andrew Carnegie and his young wife
Louise. They were on their wedding trip and on their
way to Scotland, where Mr. Carnegie had rented “Kilgraston,”
a lovely old place near Perth. He had known
my father and had invited him a few years before to a
dinner given in honor of Matthew Arnold who had been
in America on a lecture tour. Mr. Carnegie spoke of my
father with great affection and respect, and expressed his
delight that I had taken up my father’s work. He invited
me to come for a visit to Scotland after my studies
with von Bülow were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the late summer, I accordingly sailed in a small
steamer from Hamburg to Leith and was received with
great friendliness by Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie at Kilgraston.
Among their guests were James G. Blaine, his
wife, and two of their daughters. My acquaintance
with this remarkable family soon ripened very fortunately
for me into close friendship and resulted finally in my
marriage to Margaret, one of the daughters—but I am
progressing too fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Blaine had been defeated for the presidency in
1884. Since that time he had been occupied in completing
his book “Twenty Years of Congress,” and in
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
the spring of 1887 he and his family were taking a year’s
holiday abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because of my youth and the exigencies of my profession,
most of my life had been spent among musicians
and those interested in music. This was the first time
that I came into personal relations with a great statesman,
at that time the foremost in our country, and I
found to my amazement that, although an atmosphere of
great dignity surrounded him, he was absolutely simple
and gentle in his contact with other people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife, a woman of singular strength of character,
with a highly original mind and an absolute devotion to
her husband and his ambitions, was in many ways as
remarkable as he. Her knowledge of and interest in
literature—poetry, history, memoirs—was very comprehensive,
and the discussions thereon, which were constant
at Mr. Carnegie’s table, interested me immensely
and opened new worlds to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two daughters, Margaret and Harriet, high-spirited
and sharing the interests of their parents, gave them a
devotion and love so partisan and intense in its character
that it seemed at first to attract me toward them almost
more than anything else. As a boy I had suffered agonies
at seeing my father misunderstood and often attacked by
men not worthy to tie his shoe-strings, and here I found
similar conditions but on a much greater scale, as Mr.
Blaine’s career had been national and his triumphs and
defeats had enlisted the sympathies or execrations of
millions of American citizens. Music had entered but
little into the lives of the Blaine family—although since
then my wife has become enthusiastically devoted to it—and
I was really delighted that for the first time in my life
I was compelled to establish relations from a purely
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
human standpoint and without the assistance of any of
the “romantic glamour” of my profession. At this time,
however, I got but a glimpse of the Blaines, as they
stayed only a week after my arrival, but there were
delightful rumors of a four-weeks coaching trip from
London to Scotland which Mr. Carnegie was planning
for the following summer and for which we were all to
be invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carnegie was at that time a generous supporter of
Gladstone and the Liberal Party, and several of its leaders
came to Kilgraston to visit him, among them John
Morley, who impressed me immensely and for whom at
his own and the Carnegies’ request, I played excerpts
every evening from Wagner’s “Nibelungen Trilogy,” explaining
the music and the text, as Mr. Morley had never
heard the music before. I was very proud of being able
to interest so fine a mind as his in Wagner’s music, and
like to think that my Wagner lecture recitals, which in
later years I gave all over America, had their origin in
these informal talks in Scotland for Morley and the
Carnegies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incidentally, Mr. Carnegie became more and more
interested in the New York Symphony and Oratorio Societies
and consented to become their president and chief
financial supporter. The more intricate symphonic works
did not appeal to him, but he had a natural and naïve
love for music. Because of his study and intimate knowledge
of Scotch literature, poetry especially, together with
an intense affection for the country of his birth, he particularly
loved the folk-songs of Scotland, and in a high,
quavering, and somewhat uncertain voice could sing
literally dozens of them from memory. To me these
folk-songs were a revelation, and I still think that they
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
have a variety and charm beyond those of any other
race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I even adore the Scotch bagpipes and am almost in
sympathy with the Scotsman who says that his idea of
heaven is “twenty bagpipers a’ playin’ t’gither in a sma’
room and each one playing a different tune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On our long walks and fishing excursions together, Mr.
Carnegie talked continuously and freely regarding his
many plans to better the world through liberal benefactions.
He had already begun the founding of free libraries
all over Great Britain and America, and would
often tell me of his own great poverty as a child and the
difficulty of obtaining the books and education which he
craved. His imagination would kindle at the opportunities
which his libraries would give the youth of to-day,
and a constant optimism as to the future of the world
seemed to direct all his plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor salaries paid to our teaching profession would
especially arouse his ire, as he considered that the entire
future of America lay in the hands of its teachers and that,
therefore, the greatest minds of the country should be
enlisted in the work and suitably rewarded. As the
reader knows, this conviction finally culminated in his
remarkable and comprehensive scheme of pensions to
college professors who had served their calling a certain
number of years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he would unfold to me his various dreams and plans,
he became really eloquent. His little hands would clinch,
and for a moment even his fishing-pole and a possible
trout at the other end would be forgotten, especially
when he talked of his greatest aversion—war—and of
its hideous uselessness in settling any disputes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a boy he had had hardly any school education, but
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
he had inherited the Scotch passion for books. He had
read omnivorously and, what is better still, remembered
what he read. Burns and Shakespeare he knew by heart
and could quote very aptly to clinch a point in his arguments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sympathy for suffering, especially that caused by
poverty, was very great and expended itself in practical
help in every direction. The hard struggles of his early
youth had made him very understanding, and many widows
left destitute received immediate help from him and
the children were put through school and placed in business
through his assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His attitude toward religion was very curious. In those
days he professed to be an agnostic, but he had old Scotch
prejudices in favor of a “Scotch Sunday.” He despised
theology and yet was really religious, but he did not care
to define his God or to explore the mysteries or possibilities
of a future life. His prejudices were as unyielding
as the pig iron which he manufactured at his Homestead
works, and no argument would move him if his mind was
made up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Mr. Carnegie had a real admiration for music in
its simpler forms, this never crystallized into as great
a conviction regarding its importance in life as that
which he had regarding the importance of science or
literature, and though always generous in its support,
his benefactions never became as great as in other directions.
He could understand that a library, a school, or
a hospital could not and should not be self-supporting,
but I could not convince him that music should fall into
the same category. He always insisted that the greatest
patronage of music should come from a paying public
rather than from private endowment. He built Carnegie
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
Hall in order to give New York a proper home for its
musical activities, but he did not look upon this as a
philanthropy, and expected to have the hall support itself
and give a fair return upon the capital invested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1888 I again sailed for Europe with the
Carnegies, and on arriving at the Metropole Hotel in
London we found the rest of the coaching party already
assembled—the Blaine family, Mr. Henry Phipps a partner
of Mr. Carnegie’s, and Mrs. Phipps, Gail Hamilton
(Miss Dodge), a cousin of Mrs. Blaine’s well known
as a writer; also a young Universalist clergyman, Doctor
Charles Eaton, who was the pastor of Mrs. Carnegie’s
church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left the Hotel Metropole June 8, in the morning,
on top of Mr. Carnegie’s four-in-hand. There was a
great crowd of people to see us off and wish us “Bon
voyage,” among them John Morley and Lord Rosebery.
All the men of our party looked very sporty in high gray
top-hats which we had hurriedly acquired at a hatter’s
in the neighborhood that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been appointed treasurer of the tour by Mr.
Carnegie, “with no salary but all the usual perquisites,”
as he put it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coachman, a stout, good-natured Scotsman of
real ability, drove his four-in-hand with such skill and
care that when we arrived in Invernesshire four weeks
later, his horses were in even better condition than when
we started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was certainly an ideal way to travel, and the
pace was leisurely enough for us to see and enjoy the
exquisite countryside of England and Scotland. Every
night we stopped at a different inn but always carried
our lunch in hampers, and at noontime halted at some
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
picturesque nook by the bank of a river or on some grassy
meadow in the shade of the trees and enjoyed our meal
in lazy fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discussions between Mr. Blaine and Mr. Carnegie at
these picnic luncheons were certainly fascinating to listen
to, and especially illuminating to an American musician
whose horizon had perhaps been bounded too exclusively
by his own ambitions and the problems of his own art.
Mr. Blaine knew England, its history, and its great
families far more intimately than any Englishman I
have ever met. It is well known that he never forgot
anything, and whenever we stopped either for luncheon
or at an inn for the night, he would immediately proceed
to add to his immense store of knowledge by questioning
the local farmers, field workers, or innkeepers regarding
the economic or political conditions of that part of the
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An amusing opera-bouffe element of the entire coaching
trip was added by the constant but furtive appearance
and disappearance of four American newspaper reporters
who had been sent by their respective papers to “shadow”
Mr. Blaine because the Republican convention for the
presidential nomination was about to be held in Chicago,
and it was eagerly hoped that Mr. Blaine would accept
the nomination again. He, and through him we, of
course, knew that nothing was further from his mind,
but in the dusk of evening, when we would arrive at our
inn for the night, these four reporters, having travelled
by train, would already be there and try directly or indirectly
to obtain “inside information” regarding Mr.
Blaine’s intentions. The reporters included Stephen
Bonsal for the <span class='it'>New York World</span> and Arthur Brisbane
for the <span class='it'>New York Sun</span>. The latter, wishing to combine
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
pleasure with business, would sometimes scorn the train
and hire a high dog-cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our itinerary took in all the cathedral towns of the east
coast of England. We were bound by no time-tables and,
therefore, had every opportunity to see and study the
mighty Gothic churches of Cambridge, Ely, Peterborough,
York, and Durham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had agreed to conduct a concert in London on the
19th of June, and so very reluctantly said a temporary
good-by to our party at York. This concert was given
by Ovide Musin, an eminent young Belgian violinist,
who wished to perform a concerto of my father’s which he
had played in New York about eight years before under
my father’s own direction. I had an excellent London
orchestra of seventy-five players and also gave Beethoven’s
Seventh Symphony and the Liszt Hungarian
Rhapsody Number One. It was my first experience as
a conductor in England, and as the concert passed off
very well I was much elated, especially when, just before
catching my train for Durham to rejoin the coaching
party, I read some complimentary criticisms of the concert
in the <span class='it'>London Times</span> and <span class='it'>Telegraph</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was raining when I left the railroad station in Durham
to walk to the road along which Mr. Carnegie’s
coach was to appear. I well remember my thrill of joy
when I heard a merry fanfare played on the coaching
horn by one of the footmen—whom, by the way, I always
envied for his virtuosity on this instrument—and shortly
after, at a turn of the road, I saw the coach appear with
everybody on top attired in gray rain-coats and waving
a friendly welcome. My wife has always insisted to my
children that on this entire trip I wore a double-breasted
frock coat which had done previous duty at my matinée
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
concerts in America, but I think this is a gross slander
and not based on fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We crossed the border into Scotland and of course
stopped at Walter Scott’s home and also visited the ruins
of Linlithgow Castle, in which Mary Queen of Scots was
born. And here the four reporters, who had been as
constant as leeches and as inevitable as death and the
taxgatherer, solemnly entered the ruins and gave Mr.
Blaine a telegram which they had just received announcing
Benjamin Harrison’s nomination at the convention.
As Mr. Blaine had expected this for weeks, the news did
not excite him greatly. He bade a friendly good-by to
the four young sleuth-hounds, several of whom have
since achieved fame in their profession, and we continued
our journey farther north until we arrived at Mr. Carnegie’s
home, Cluny Castle, on the evening of July 3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was bitter cold and the wind was whistling shrilly
over the Dalwhinny Moors as we first caught sight of
Cluny, but an American flag was floating proudly over
its turrets, and inside warm fires and a delicious dinner
were awaiting us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then began a summer of delights for me. Mr. Carnegie
had a piper who, according to old Scotch custom,
would walk around the outer walls of the house every
morning to awaken us. My room was in the bachelor
quarters and had a little fireplace in which a peat fire
smouldered comfortably. The smell of peat and the
sound of the piper as he drew nearer and nearer to my
window and then again receded in the distance are always
inseparably associated in my memory. In the
mornings I usually worked at my studies in counterpoint
and composition, but from luncheon on it was nothing
but delightful entertainment or listening with keenest
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
interest to discussions of all kinds—political, economic,
poetical. Miss Dodge was a most stimulating person.
She had a mind that would accept nothing without analysis
or proof, and the verbal duels between her and Mr.
Carnegie were fascinating, for, although she was not
Scotch, she, as much as Mr. Carnegie, typified the story
of the two Scotsmen who meet each other and one says:
“Where are you going, Donald?” “Oh, just doon to
the village to contradict a wee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally I would accompany Mr. Carnegie to some
lonely loch among the hills to fish for trout, but I have
never developed into a very ardent disciple of Izaak
Walton. I used to get more pleasure from lying on my
back watching the marvellous Scotch sky with its low-hanging
clouds framing the hills in their loving embrace,
with perhaps now and then just a speck of blue shining
through, than from the catching of the “finny monsters.”
These, however, rarely measured over six inches in length,
although I certainly enjoyed them the following morning,
when we had them for breakfast, rolled in oatmeal
flour and deliciously fried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evenings I had to contribute my little quota
toward the house-party by playing Beethoven and Wagner
on an excellent Broadwood piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During all this time I was amazed at the extreme simplicity
and gentleness which characterized Mr. Blaine’s
demeanor toward all with whom he came in contact.
Here was a man who at that time was the most loved
and the most execrated American, and yet he had in him
absolutely nothing of the “prima donna” manner of many
of those in my profession who have achieved fame. His
dignity, however, was innate and unconscious, and during
the many years that I knew him and knew him intimately
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
I have never seen any one who dared to presume on his
simplicity and general cordiality of manner by undue
familiarity. His power of abstraction from his surroundings
was remarkable. He enjoyed working in the room
in which his family were talking, laughing, and disputing
on all manner of subjects, while he would sit in a corner
concentrated on some problem of his own and work it
out, absolutely oblivious to what was going on about
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blaine family left Cluny all too soon, and not
only I, but the entire household felt their absence
keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other guests followed, among them John Morley, with
whom I went on long and to me very interesting walks.
He seemed a very lonely and perhaps a disappointed
man. He was married, but childless, and told me once
that the great regret of his life was that he had no son,
as he would like to have brought him up and educated
him according to a theory all his own as to what an
Englishman’s training really should be. How many men
have had such dreams and how few, if any, can really
control the future of their children!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In March, 1889, Benjamin Harrison was inaugurated
President and Mr. Blaine became his secretary of state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was, as usual, terribly busy that winter with the opera,
concerts, and Wagner lecture recitals, and there were
times when Washington seemed very far away, but
Margaret Blaine had good friends in New York whom
she visited occasionally, also a sister, the wife of Colonel
Coppinger of the United States army, who was stationed
at Governor’s Island in New York harbor. Whenever
she stayed with Mrs. Coppinger I was a very frequent
passenger on the little ferry-boat which seemed to me
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
maintained by our beneficent War Department for the
sole purpose of enabling young men like myself to reach
this picturesque though antiquated military fortress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Carnegie was absolutely unconscious of my aspirations
regarding Margaret Blaine, and the following summer
he suggested a visit to Bar Harbor, where Mr. Blaine
had built a summer home. I accepted with an alacrity
which he mistook as springing only from the same source
as his own desire to see again the friends who had contributed
so much toward the delights of the coaching
trip and Cluny Castle. When I afterward told him of
my hopes and that they had received some encouragement
during our Bar Harbor visit, he was very much put out
and vowed that if he had ever suspected anything of the
kind he would never have taken me with him. He told
me that he had hoped I would not think of marriage for
many years, but would remain as a kind of semi-attached
musical member of his household, which at that time consisted
only of himself and his wife. Of course I listened
to his many arguments absolutely unconvinced, and obstinate
though he always was, he found his equal in me. I
must confess, however, that when he saw how much in
earnest I was, he not only completely receded from his
position, but accepted my engagement and marriage with
absolute good humor and approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My engagement to Margaret Blaine was announced in
October of the following year at the wedding of her
brother, Emmons, to Anita McCormick, of Chicago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Blaine had bought the old Seward mansion on
Lafayette Square, very near the White House, and Mrs.
Blaine, who had a remarkable flair for harmonious house
furnishings and decorations, proceeded to make it into
a dignified and charming house, the special feature of
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
which was a large drawing-room on the first floor, created
by changing two rooms into one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have told elsewhere how in those days I was compelled,
because of my youth, to confine myself at the Metropolitan
to the conducting of such operas as “Le Prophète,”
“La Juive,” and “Trovatore.” Seidl, my older colleague,
completely monopolized the Wagner operas,
which I was of course particularly anxious to conduct.
Against “Trovatore” I had at that time a particularly
strong and unreasonable aversion, although it was partly
justified in that we did not have a cast in our German
Opera Company that could do justice to its Italian atmosphere
or its vocal demands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever good luck would have it that the Saturday
matinée was a Wagner opera, I would ask for and obtain
from Director Stanton the permission to leave for Washington
on Friday night, as this would enable me to spend
Saturday and Sunday with my fiancée. On one of these
Fridays, just after I had received my permission, my
brother Frank came to me and urged me to take the first
train to Washington that I could catch, as he had just
heard that the tenor who was to sing in “Siegfried” on
Saturday afternoon was ill, and that in all probability the
opera would be changed to “Trovatore.” I quickly took
the hint, and when the message came that I was to conduct
“Trovatore,” I was nowhere to be found and Anton
Seidl was compelled to conduct it. He was furious, as he
had no greater love for it than I, and my brother told me
afterward that he conducted the entire opera with a black
scowl on his face, which was bent low over the score and
from which he never lifted his eyes once to give a sign to
singer or orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the following winter, tragedies began to overwhelm
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
the Blaine family. Walker, the eldest son, a
young man of great talent who had inherited much of
his father’s personal charm and who had become a great
help to Mr. Blaine in the State Department, died, to be
followed shortly after by the oldest daughter, Mrs.
Coppinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two tragedies, following so closely upon each
other, were the first break in that perfect family circle,
and this affected Mr. Blaine’s spirit and health to such
an extent that I do not think his vitality ever recovered
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was married to Margaret Blaine on May 17, 1890. I
should like to write much more than a chapter about the
thirty-two wonderful years of our married life, but as my
wife has sternly forbidden me to even mention her name
in these memoirs, this chapter must close with the best
left unsaid, though the most deeply felt.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span><h1>X</h1></div>

<h3>THE DAMROSCH OPERA COMPANY, 1895-1899</h3>

<p class='pindent'>With the return of Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau in 1891,
Wagner virtually disappeared from the stage of the Metropolitan
Opera House as their entire energies were turned
toward producing operas of the French-Italian School.
It was a natural reaction from the seven years of opera in
German and the pendulum swung far to the other side.
A company of truly great singers had been assembled by
the new managers; the audiences revelled in their <span class='it'>bel
canto</span>, and as Abbey, Schoeffel, and Grau assumed the
entire financial responsibility of the enterprise, the directors
of the opera-house were also well satisfied. They had
become tired of the growing deficits of the German opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head and controlling spirit of the firm was Henry
Abbey, a magnificent and honorable gambler in “stars”
whom he paid so liberally that, while he sometimes gained
large profits, he many times lost more heavily. The
chances of profit were too small and generally it was too
much like the roulette tables at Monte Carlo, with the
odds in favor of the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Schoeffel was not much more than the hyphen
between Abbey and Grau. I never could see that he did
anything except, perhaps, arrange for the advertisements
of the opera company when it visited Boston, where he
lived as lessee of the Tremont Theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The actual direction of the opera season, the arranging
of the repertoire, the engagement of the artists, and the
handling of them was in the hands of Maurice Grau, who
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
had developed into a first-class opera manager. He
claimed but little knowledge of things artistic, but he
was astute and had a real flair, up to a certain point, for
giving the public what it wanted. He was honorable in
his dealings with the artists and in a grudging way (which
operatic artists often have) they liked him, although they
tortured him incessantly. He used to sit in his office
like a spider from morning until night, working out repertoires,
quarrelling with the singers or placating them, and
altogether having no interests in life beyond that—except,
perhaps, the national game of poker, in which he and a
small group of cronies used to indulge—and a great affection
for his little daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of “Lohengrin,” which had sporadic
performances in the Italian language, poor Wagner was
virtually boycotted, and with my great adoration for him
I chafed under this condition more and more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The winter of 1893-94 I had been asked to arrange
something original in the way of an entertainment for a
charity in which I was interested, and as Materna, Anton
Schott, and Emil Fischer were at that time in America,
I conceived the idea of giving a stage performance of the
“Götterdämmerung” at Carnegie Hall. Materna was
old and fat, but her voice was still glorious; Anton Schott
still made a personable <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>, and Emil Fischer was
at the height of his vocal and histrionic powers. The
scenery, though simple, was well improvised and part of
it specially painted, and the weapons and other properties
were borrowed from the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success was so remarkable that we repeated the
work several times and added “Walküre.” This seemed
to me conclusive proof that the American public were
more than ready for the return of Wagner, and I called
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
on Abbey and Grau to suggest that they include a certain
number of Wagner performances in German in their
repertoire. They threw up their hands in horror at
the idea, saying that Wagner spelled ruin, but as they
were very kindly disposed toward me (I had conducted
many orchestral concerts for some of their instrumental
stars) they suggested that if I wanted to be foolish enough
to give Wagner performances myself, they would gladly
rent the Metropolitan Opera House to me in the spring
and on easy terms. Almost irresistibly I was drawn into
the resolve to take their suggestion seriously, although it
was made laughingly and sceptically as to its outcome.
I consulted a number of devoted friends who shared my
optimism and finally decided to make the plunge, and, in
order to finance my mad scheme properly, I sold my house
on West 55th Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the home of Miss Mary Callender and Miss Caro de
Forest, both of them true friends and music lovers, a
“Wagner Society” was formed, the purpose of which was
to help the sale of subscription seats for my venture and
to spread the propaganda for the project in every way.
At the first meeting of this society so many seats were subscribed
for that the success seemed assured, and, besides
this, the directors of the Metropolitan Opera House, although
they were entitled to the free use of their boxes,
suggested to me very generously that as Abbey and Grau
would charge a nominal rental of five hundred dollars a
night for my performances they would pay me that
amount for the use of their boxes, so that I should have
the house virtually rent free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbey and Grau, who looked on me as a kind of foolish
boy who was plunging madly toward destruction, told
me with equal generosity that I could have whatever of
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
their enormous stock of costumes and properties might
prove of use for the Wagner operas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time I received a letter from Mr. William
Steinway, then the head of the house of Steinway &amp; Sons,
and a great lover of music, asking me to come down to
see him, as he was very much interested in my project for
the return of Wagner to the Metropolitan. I did so and
found him at his desk crippled with gout but very cheerful
and happy over my venture, for which he prophesied great
success. He suggested, however, that while he realized
that the idea and the venture were entirely mine, and
that I was entitled to every credit and advantage from
it, it would be a very generous act on my part if I invited
Anton Seidl to share the conducting of the Wagner
operas and music-dramas. He pointed out that Seidl was
looked on by the American public as a great Wagner conductor,
and his co-operation would show that I intended
to found my project on the broadest and most generous
lines. He said that if I would agree to his suggestion,
he would arrange a meeting for Seidl and myself at his
office for the following day, and I could be sure of his
heartiest personal and financial support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thought well of his idea, and, while Seidl and I had
never been on cordial personal terms during the old German
opera days, nor afterward when we went our separate
ways as concert conductors, I felt that the project might
be much strengthened by a combination, and accordingly
met Seidl, together with William Steinway, in the latter’s
office the following day. I outlined my project to Seidl,
told him of the support I had already gained, of my arrangement
with Abbey and Grau, and that I was financing
the scheme myself, but that, with full admiration for his
work in America during the years of German opera after
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
my father’s death, I should be glad to divide the Wagner
operas with him. I showed him a list of the eight I intended
to produce. They were, as I remember, as follows:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Rhinegold”</p>
<p class='line'>“Walküre”</p>
<p class='line'>“Siegfried”</p>
<p class='line'>“Götterdämmerung”</p>
<p class='line'>“Tristan and Isolde”</p>
<p class='line'>“Meistersinger”</p>
<p class='line'>“Lohengrin”</p>
<p class='line'>“Tannhäuser”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>I suggested to him that he should pick out the four
which he preferred and that I would conduct the other
four. Steinway pronounced this offer extremely fair and
generous and urged Seidl to accept it, but Seidl said he
would have to think it over and would notify Steinway
of his decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day he called on Steinway at nine o’clock in the
morning and told him that he had come to the conclusion
that he would not divide the conducting of the Wagner
operas with any one and, therefore, preferred not to have
anything to do with the venture. Steinway was furious,
and when he told me of this he said: “I am now with you
heart and soul and here is my check for twenty-five hundred
dollars for which I will take subscription seats for
your season in different parts of the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I arranged for a season of eight weeks at the Metropolitan
and a tour of five weeks which should take us as far
west as Kansas City, as this Far Western outpost had
immediately put in a generous bid for three performances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went abroad that spring to engage my artists and
succeeded in gathering a notable company of Wagnerian
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
singers: Rosa Sucher, of the Berlin Royal Opera for the
<span class='it'>Brunhildes</span> and <span class='it'>Isolde</span>; a young singer of twenty-three,
Johanna Gadski, who sang for me in Berlin, for <span class='it'>Elsa</span>
and <span class='it'>Elizabeth</span>; Emil Fischer, of the Dresden Royal Opera,
for <span class='it'>Wotan</span> and <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span>, and Max Alvary, the handsomest
and most dramatic of <span class='it'>Siegfrieds</span> and a truly
knightly <span class='it'>Tristan</span>. He had studied the latter rôle at
Bayreuth and had sung it there at the first performances.
At Bayreuth I also found a highly gifted English singer,
Marie Brema, who was then almost unknown but who
was the possessor of a rich and expressive mezzo-soprano.
Her talent for acting was remarkable and her vocal range
so great that I thought I could use her not only for
<span class='it'>Ortrude</span> and <span class='it'>Brangäne</span>, but, if necessary, for the <span class='it'>Brunhildes</span>
as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great deal of the scenery for “Tristan” and the
“Nibelung Trilogy” as well as for “Tannhäuser” I had
especially painted in Vienna by the firm of Kautsky and
Briosky. They were at that time at the head of their
profession, and such beautiful foliage as, for instance, in
the forest scene of “Siegfried,” had never before been
seen on an American stage. Our New York painters
gathered around it in amazement when it had been unpacked
and properly mounted and hung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such an expert on naval matters as William J. Henderson,
the eminent music editor of the <span class='it'>New York Sun</span>,
deservedly criticised the architecture and rigging of the
ship that bore <span class='it'>Tristan</span> and <span class='it'>Isolde</span> across the Irish seas to
Cornwall. Vienna, the home of my scene-painters, is
not a seaport, and the gorgeous tent of <span class='it'>Isolde’s</span>, and the
sails and mast, while very picturesque, completely hid
the course of the ship from <span class='it'>Tristan</span> at the helm, and if he
had not been an operatic sailor, who knew exactly where
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
the ship was going to land at the end of the act, he undoubtedly
would have sent it crashing against the white-chalk
cliffs of England instead of guiding it safely into
the harbor of Cornwall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meanwhile, the subscriptions for seats at our
New York office had gone up by such leaps and bounds
that the financial success of my “crazy venture” was
assured before the box-office opened for the single sale of
tickets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had chosen “Tristan” for the opening performance.
It was in 1895. The general rehearsal had gone well and
an immense audience filled every available space of the
opera-house and greeted me warmly as I appeared on the
conductor’s stand. I was just about to begin the prelude
when a whisper reached me that the English horn
player was not in his place. It was old Joseph Eller, who
had played in the Philharmonic under my father many
years before. He had, incredible to relate, forgotten
his instrument and, discovering this only on his arrival
at the Metropolitan, had rushed home but had not yet
returned. Imagine my agitation! Everything was ready,
the lights turned down and the audience expectant, and
I finally did not dare to wait any longer. I assigned
the English horn part to the third French horn player
and we began the long-drawn sighs of the violoncellos of
the introductory bars of the prelude. To my great relief
I saw Eller slip into his place a few minutes later, and
the performance moved well and dramatically toward a
triumphant close, in which Alvary, especially, distinguished
himself by his marvellous acting and impassioned
singing in the scene preceding the arrival of the ship bearing
<span class='it'>Isolde</span>. Sucher invested <span class='it'>Isolde</span> with a gentle, womanly
dignity, but vocally she was no longer quite in her
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
prime and did not, I think, equal Lilli Lehmann or
Klafsky and Ternina, whom I brought to America the
following year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To re-enter the Metropolitan on such a Wagnerian wave
after German opera had been so ignominiously snuffed
out five years before, was a great triumph and satisfaction
for me, more especially because my father had laid
the foundation eleven years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I produced the other Wagnerian operas in quick succession,
and as the houses were sold out for every performance
the profit was considerable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Marie Brema proved herself such a valuable
member of the company, both as <span class='it'>Ortrude</span> and <span class='it'>Brangäne</span>,
that I felt it would be wise to give her the opportunity
to sing <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> in “Walküre” as well. I, therefore,
quietly began to train her in that rôle. Unfortunately,
during a rehearsal which I had with her alone on the
stage, Madame Sucher happened to saunter in and, hearing
the familiar music coming from my piano, she suddenly
beheld another woman singing <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>. She
gave me one indignant but comprehensive glance and
then majestically sailed off the stage. A few hours
later I received a letter in which she announced to me that
she wished to return to Germany on the next steamer, as
she had not been accustomed until then to have “her”
rôles sung by another as long as she was in the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first letter of the kind that I had received
during my short career as opera impresario, but it was
but the prototype of many similar ones that followed each
other like snowflakes in a storm during my various opera
seasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, of course, immediately sent Madame Sucher a large
bouquet of roses and wrote to her that, quite apart from
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
contractual obligations, I could not understand how she
would want to leave America after she had “sung herself
so gloriously into the hearts of my countrymen.” I do
not know whether my letter or the roses had any effect, or
whether wiser counsels prevailed, but she stayed with me
and continued her work with great good nature and even
endured the hated sight of having Marie Brema sing
<span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> at several of the subsequent performances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Kansas City we ended our stay with a matinée
performance of “Siegfried,” Madame Sucher as <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>
and Max Alvary, the handsome, as <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>. My readers
will remember the great scene in which <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> is
awakened from her slumber of years by the kiss of <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>,
who bends over her in that delightful but difficult
position for a long time until a certain bar in the music
denotes that the kiss is ended. The house was crowded
and the greater part of the audience were women. Suddenly,
while I was conducting the exquisite music accompanying
the extended kiss, some one in the gallery inclined
to facetiousness imitated very distinctly the smacking
sound of kissing, and, to my horror, little ripples of feminine
laughter rose and fell, awoke and died, to be renewed
again. Alvary was wonderful. He raised his handsome
head, gazed with calm eyes at the audience until a death-like
silence reigned and then, with equal calm, returned
to his previous occupation. It was certainly a triumph
of man over woman, or rather women, and at the end of
the act they greeted this young god with special and adoring
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire profits of my first venture as owner and
director of an opera company for thirteen weeks amounted
to about fifty-three thousand dollars. (Alas! I did not
retain this quickly gained fortune a long time.)</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
I had again planted the flag of Wagner firmly in American
ground and naturally did not wish to see it pulled
down again. I therefore called on Abbey and Grau and—as
I had no desire for managerial honors, the artistic side
of it only interesting me—begged them to add a German
department to their really splendid galaxy of French and
Italian artists and to let me take care of it for them. But
at that time they did not seem ready to alter their traditional
operatic scheme, and my suggestion did not meet
with a favorable response. I then decided that I would
go on myself. My first season had taught me a great
deal. I had acquired a considerable stock of scenery,
costumes, and properties, and I knew where I could still
further improve the artistic personnel of my company. I
thought that by arranging for a longer season of five
months I should be able to give my singers and orchestra
better contracts financially and also introduce the Wagner
operas over a greater territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All my friends except one urged me to go on with the
work. The one exception was Andrew Carnegie who
said, with that canny business acumen which made him
one of the world’s richest men:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walter, you have made a great success, artistically
as well as financially; your profits have been enormous.
But such a success rarely repeats itself immediately.
You rightly divined the desire of the public for a return
of Wagner opera, but this current has drawn into it
many people who have come for curiosity only, and to
whom Wagner is still a closed book. Many of these
will not come back another time. Be contented to rest
on your laurels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course I would not listen to such good business
advice and accordingly engaged a company of singers
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
for the following year, who made a really remarkable
ensemble. Among the newcomers was Madame Katherine
Klafsky whose overwhelming impersonations of
<span class='it'>Brunhilde</span>, <span class='it'>Isolde</span>, and especially of <span class='it'>Fidelio</span>, still vibrate
in my memory. This last opera gave me such joy to conduct
that, although it never drew within a thousand dollars
as much as any of the other operas, I would insist on
keeping it in the repertoire. This proves conclusively
that the artist in me was much stronger than the impresario
and that I really had no business to engage in
the latter occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Fidelio</span> (<span class='it'>Leonore</span>), in the second act, liberates her husband
from his shackles in the prison, and he says to her,
“O, my Leonore, how much hast thou done for me!”
She answers, “Nothing, nothing, my Florestan,” and the
orchestra begins a soft murmur, upon which the two voices
rise in an ecstatic duet of love. Klafsky gave this scene
with such tenderness that the entire orchestra, as well
as myself, were by this time almost choking with emotion,
and it was all that I could do to lift my baton to give the
signal for the beginning of the duet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Ternina, another newcomer, was prevented
by illness from appearing in Chicago, but in Boston she
created a genuine sensation. The public divided itself
into two factions, the one extolling the almost elemental
dramatic vehemence of Klafsky, who fairly poured out her
glorious voice, while the other proclaimed Ternina the
greater artist because of her more intellectual conception
and a certain noble artistic reticence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part of the summer of 1894 I had spent in beginning
the music of an opera on Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet
Letter.” The subject had always fascinated me and I
had years before prepared a dramatic scenario for which
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
I finally induced Hawthorne’s son-in-law, George Parsons
Lathrop, to prepare a libretto. I completed the
composition of the music the following summer and decided
to produce it during the season 1895-96 with the
Damrosch Opera Company in Boston, where the scene of
the original novel is laid, in the old Colonial days of
Governor Endicott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave the rôle of <span class='it'>Hester Prynne</span> to Johanna Gadski.
David Bispham played <span class='it'>Roger Chillingworth</span>, and Barron
Berthold sang the clergyman, <span class='it'>Arthur Dimmesdale</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first performance took place February 10, 1896.
American audiences are proverbially kind to authors on
first nights, and Boston was especially interested in this
opera because of Hawthorne’s novel. The scenery presented
old Boston in very picturesque fashion, and I had
spent a good deal of time with my stage-manager and
costumer in the different Boston collections of Colonial
belongings in order to give a correct picture of that period.
Early portraits were consulted for the “make-up” of
Governor Endicott and other old Boston celebrities, and
the “company of ancient and honorable artillery” who
appeared in the last act carried an exact copy of the
banner which still hangs, I think, in Faneuil Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gadski gave a very touching impersonation of <span class='it'>Hester</span>,
and Bispham fairly revelled in the fiendish machinations
of <span class='it'>Roger Chillingworth</span>. The artists and composer received
numberless recalls and the members of my company
united in presenting me with several charming mementos
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. John L. Gardner, who had already in those days
become a real and loyal friend and supporter, and who
has, according to her wonderful capacity for friendship,
continued as such during these many years, sent a huge
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
laurel wreath to the stage for me, the centre of which
contained a large scarlet letter “A”! The reader may
imagine what jokes were cracked at my expense about
that very prominently displayed letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music was, I think, well written and orchestrated,
but so much of it had been conceived under the overwhelming
influence of Wagner, that I am afraid Anton
Seidl was right when, after hearing the work in New
York, he confided cynically to his friends that it was a
“New England Nibelung Trilogy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reviewing the work critically myself after these many
years, I would say that it showed sufficient talent and
musicianly grasp to warrant a composer’s career, but life
and its exigencies willed otherwise, and all the “might
have beens” are but idle speculation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An evil star seemed to shine over that winter’s opera
season from the financial standpoint. The entire country
was suffering from a severe financial depression and
my company was large and expensive. I had to travel
continually, and during the entire five months carried a
company of one hundred and seventy people, including
an orchestra of seventy men, as I considered so large an
aggregation my solemn duty as a Wagner disciple and
propagandist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Abbey and Grau finally decided to embark on a German
opera department of their own, adopting my suggestion
when it was too late for me to combine with them,
they very naturally shut me out of the Metropolitan
Opera House and I was compelled, for my New York
season, to lease the old Academy of Music which had become
a house for cheap theatrical productions and had
lost its high fashionable estate of other years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My seasons in Chicago and Boston had been profitable,
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
but many cities in the South, with the exception of New
Orleans, which gave me a wonderful welcome, could not
pay expenses, as the theatres were too small and my company
too large and literally too good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In New Orleans we played an entire week at the old
St. Charles Theatre. The dressing-rooms for the chorus
were in the cellar and just before the first performance
the women of the chorus ran shrieking up on the stage,
vowing that they would not return, as rats as large as
good-sized rabbits were scampering around the cellar.
I could not believe them until I went down and saw those
horrible creatures with my own eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our last performance was to have been on Saturday
night, but on that day I received a petition signed by a
number of citizens asking whether we could give them a
“Fidelio” performance with Madame Klafsky on Sunday
morning. As our train was to leave at three P. M.
on that day, we had to begin this performance at eleven
o’clock in the morning. The announcement that this
extra performance was to be given was made only the
night before and in the Sunday morning papers. By
eleven o’clock the house was sold out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the company as far west as Denver and everywhere
virtually introduced for the first time the “Trilogy,”
“Tristan,” and “Die Meistersinger” to the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember a performance in Providence, Rhode Island,
where, in default of a theatre, the armory had been adapted
for us by an improvised stage which was, however, so low
that the orchestra could easily see what was going on.
The opera was “Lohengrin,” and just before the scene in
the last act, when <span class='it'>Godfrey</span>, the little brother of <span class='it'>Elsa</span>,
appears in place of the magic swan to rush into the outstretched
arms of <span class='it'>Elsa</span>, the stage-manager suddenly discovered
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
that the little ballet girl who always assumed the
rôle was not present. What to do? In the emergency
he grabbed Hans, son of my prompter and at that time a
kind of assistant to everybody as call-boy, assistant librarian,
etc., etc. He was only fourteen and small of
stature but with the excessive length of arms and legs
characteristic of that age. By some painful process
he was forced into the costume of <span class='it'>Godfrey</span> and pushed
on the stage just in the nick of time. I suddenly noticed
a commotion among my orchestra, and as I followed
their astonished but delighted gaze I saw the uncanny
apparition of Hans as a counterfeit <span class='it'>Godfrey</span> standing
on the stage evidently frightened out of his wits.
Gadski, who sang <span class='it'>Elsa</span>, with great presence of mind,
stretched her arms wide and not only welcomed, but
extinguished him beneath the voluminous folds of her
cloak and I doubt whether the public realized that the
real princely brother had not made his appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we finally arrived in New York, I had already
lost a great deal of the large profits of the year before,
and this loss was further increased by my season at the
Academy of Music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the New York season my wife and I stayed at
the stately old house of our dear friends, Sophie and Tina
Furniss, on Fifth Avenue and Fortieth Street. With
characteristic kindness, they not only took a large proscenium
box for every performance, but, having heard
that affairs had not gone well financially, insisted that we
must be their guests for the entire New York season,
in order, I suppose, that I should not have to incur the
extravagance of an hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These elderly ladies, together with a married sister,
Mrs. Zimmermann, were the daughters of an old East
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
India merchant who, in the earlier part of the nineteenth
century, had amassed a fortune. Their house was full of
lovely old furniture and mementos of a bygone age and
they dispensed within its walls a very generous and dignified
hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old colored coachman named Brown had been with
them for forty years. He always, together with a young
colored footman, sat high up on their carriage in great
state and solemnity. The young footman having been
sent away in disgrace during our stay, Brown was instructed
to procure another boy to take his place. A
week elapsed and the new boy had not been found, and
when Miss Sophie said to him: “Brown, why haven’t
you gotten us a new boy? Are they difficult to find?”
he answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss Sophie, there’s plenty o’ boys, but ah find
it so hard to ma’ch mah colah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He evidently was a great stickler for unanimity, not
only in the color of the livery but of the skin as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Sophie, the oldest of these three delightful ladies,
had an incredible vitality, and although bodily infirmities
and advancing years did their best to curb her, she
remained active, cheerful, and undaunted until the end.
Almost every night during my opera season of six weeks
she would hobble from the carriage to her proscenium
box, supported by her cane on one side and the footman
on the other, and she listened to the Wagnerian music-dramas
with unflagging attention. Not even the length
of “Götterdämmerung” or “Meistersinger” would phase
her, and after the performance, during supper, she would
proudly repeat, while her eyes fairly snapped with laughter,
some remark of mine that I had made two years before
at their country place in Lenox, during my delivery
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
of a series of explanatory recitals on the “Nibelung
Trilogy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another fellow guest was Doctor Sturgis Bigelow, an
enthusiastic admirer of Madame Ternina’s art, who had
come to New York especially to be present at all of her
appearances. She was to have made her farewell to
America in the “Götterdämmerung” and Doctor Bigelow
had ordered enough flowers from half a dozen of the
florists of Broadway and Fifth Avenue to fill the entire
Academy, but unfortunately Madame Ternina became
ill and her place had to be taken at the last moment by
her rival, Madame Klafsky. Doctor Bigelow had no desire
to present the floral testimony of his adoration to this
rival singer, and therefore proceeded on the difficult task
of cancelling his many orders, but as many of the wreaths
and lyres had already been prepared, his bill for “damages”
was quite large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Ternina sailed for home she told me that she
intended to stay away for a few years. I had paid her
five hundred dollars an appearance which was a fair
honorarium at that time, as she was absolutely unknown
and therefore had not yet developed a sufficient “drawing
power” to warrant a higher fee, but she said she
would not come back to America until she could command
a fee of a thousand dollars. This decision she
adhered to, and when she did return a few years later,
Maurice Grau cheerfully paid her the thousand dollars
and she was immediately proclaimed one of the greatest
<span class='it'>Isoldes</span> of our time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My New York season opened on March 4, 1896, with
Beethoven’s “Fidelio.” The audience was a distinguished
one, containing a great many of the old Academy habitués.
Grand opera had not been given there since 1888,
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
when the tenor, Italo Campanini, had brought over an
Italian opera company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Klafsky I have already spoken, but my new barytone,
Dimitri Popovici, also made a sensation. I had
found him in Bayreuth, where he had sung <span class='it'>Telramund</span> and
<span class='it'>Kurvenal</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I produced my own opera, “The Scarlet Letter,” during
the second week, and the reception accorded it was
more than cordial. As the Symphony Society of New
York wished to present me with an exquisitely bound
copy of Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter” as a memento,
Richard Welling, the secretary and an old friend, suggested
to Anton Seidl, who was in the audience, that
he be spokesman, but as he refused Welling presented
the book to me himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the balance-sheet of the five months’ season
showed a “loss of forty-three thousand dollars,” the
larger part of my gains of the year before, I cannot say
that my wife and I were very much cast down. Youth is
optimistic, and the loss of money is, in itself, not such a
dreadful calamity if one still has enough to pay one’s
debts; and all this time I was adding to my experience
and artistic stature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a long consultation with my wife we both decided
that the conditions under which I had worked that
disastrous winter were not normal, and that we could
well risk another season. Two factors influenced me
greatly in this decision: one, that a group of Philadelphia
citizens had come forward and desired me to consider
their Academy of Music as my artistic home, and said
that they would give every possible assistance to a regular
season there, and the other was that Abbey and Grau
frankly confessed to me that they had made a mistake
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
in not accepting my offer of a combination. They had
not been fortunate in the choice of their German singers
and had lost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on
their German operas, which was nearly four times as
much as I had lost. Grau suggested for the following
season an interchange of certain artists, and if I would
occasionally lend him Madame Klafsky, whom he admired
greatly, he would in turn give me Madame Calvé
for a few performances of “Carmen.” This arrangement
seemed admirable to me, as I was beginning to feel that
Wagner opera alone was not sufficient to give a well-balanced
opera season, and that for a longer season Philadelphia
would demand a more varied repertoire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the following season of 1897-98 affairs moved much
easier for me. The Philadelphia committee gave me a
guarantee for a regular opera season at the Philadelphia
Academy of Music. This assured me a home and a permanent
place for my large store of scenery, costumes,
and properties. Rehearsals also were thus made easier
and, for my New York season in the spring, Abbey and
Grau again rented the Metropolitan Opera House to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had re-engaged Madame Klafsky, but to our great
sorrow she died, and the problem of finding a successor
was a serious one. Madame Gadski, who had charmed
our audiences with <span class='it'>Elsa</span>, <span class='it'>Elizabeth</span>, and <span class='it'>Sieglinde</span>, was
rather young for the heavy dramatic rôles, although I
had begun to train her in the “Walküre” and “Siegfried”
<span class='it'>Brunhildes</span>. I began negotiations with Lilli Lehmann
and was successful in obtaining her wonderful services
for the following year—but of this I have written in detail
in another chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The financial results of this season were quite satisfactory,
but I was beginning to chafe more and more under
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
the unsympathetic task of manager. To rehearse
singers and orchestra from morning until night was a
pleasure, because there was an artistic ideal to be achieved
and because there were all manner of musical difficulties
to be overcome. That was part of my work as a musician
and conductor, and the fatigues and worries connected
with this were easily endured. But the managerial
duties annoyed me, and the constant intrigues
among the singers, directed sometimes against each other
and at other times against the management, often seemed
to me unbearable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1898 Madame Nellie Melba, the golden-voiced,
told me that she would like to join my company
for the following winter, and suggested that her manager,
Mr. Charles Ellis, well known as the manager of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, form a partnership with me, the
company to be called The Damrosch-Ellis Opera Company,
half of the repertoire to be devoted, as before, to the
Wagner operas and the other half to the performance of
French-Italian operas with herself as the principal singer.
We were to pay her fifteen hundred dollars a night, ten
times a month, guaranteed. The suggestion seemed to me
reasonable and advantageous, and arrangements were
made accordingly. This combination aroused great indignation
on the part of Mr. George Haven, the president of
the Metropolitan Opera House. Mme. Melba had been
one of the principal singers there for several years and
he felt that it was an act of ingratitude on her part to
leave the Metropolitan, and on mine to take her into my
company, as I had myself been associated with the
Metropolitan during so many years while he was president.
I did not think that his anger was justified, as a
great deal of water had flowed down-stream since those
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
days; and, as Melba, for reasons of her own, had definitely
decided to sever all connections with the Metropolitan,
I could not see why I should not make her a
member of my company. But he could not, or would
not, see my side of the controversy, and vowed that as
long as he was president of the Metropolitan I should
never set foot in it again in a professional capacity. This
vow, however, was subsequently not adhered to, as I
not only gave performances there later with my own
company, but during the seasons of 1900-01 and 1901-02
officiated again as conductor of the Wagner operas for
Maurice Grau, who had then become the sole director
and lessee of the Metropolitan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combination of Wagnerian operas with the operas
of the French-Italian school, of which Melba was the
glorious star, proved successful from a popular and financial
standpoint, and the season showed a handsome
profit for Ellis and myself, although a great part of this
was dissipated by a spring tour in which Melba, supported
by a small company of singers, chorus, and orchestra,
toured the Western cities. This tour was managed
by my partner, Ellis, and I did not accompany them, as
my services as conductor were not needed for the French
operas. I had by that time definitely decided to give up
all further connection with opera as manager and devote
my future life absolutely to purely musical work as a
symphonic conductor and, as I hoped, also as composer.
The harassing occupation of “managing” singers proved
increasingly distasteful to me, and I felt that I was too
good a musician and artist to waste my time with such
things in which the only advantage could be a possible
pecuniary gain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found that many singers were like children with no
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
clear conception of right or wrong. Their constant life
in close proximity to each other at rehearsals and performances
often begets an exaggerated conception of
themselves and their importance to the world. They
think that as their contact with the public is only over
the footlights, where they receive enthusiastic acclaim for
their artistic representations, the public literally exists
only for the purpose of hearing them sing, and they
willingly ignore the fact that the public may have other
interests, such as family, finance, politics, or religion to
claim its attention. As it is important for a manager
not only to maintain a balance in his ledger but to seek
the best results that a disciplined ensemble may attain,
he cannot always be in harmony with all the individual
desires and demands of his artists. He must often cast
his opera in opposition to their personal pride, and I have
letters to-day from several of the greatest artists of my
company insisting that they must leave or break their
contracts because I had wounded their deepest sensibilities
in putting so and so in the rôle which they claimed
for their very own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found that some of them even indulged in occasional
efforts at petty blackmailing. One of my tenors, who
shall be nameless, had a clause in his contract that he
should not be called upon to sing <span class='it'>Tristan</span> the day after a
very long railway journey. We had played in Cleveland,
giving a “Lohengrin” performance in which, however,
the other tenor had appeared, and took a night
train in comfortable sleeping-cars in one of which my
tenor occupied a drawing-room to Pittsburgh, which is,
as my reader is aware, a distance of only 150 miles or so.
As we left Cleveland my friend the tenor appeared in my
drawing-room, and, calling attention to the clause in his
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
contract relating to <span class='it'>Tristan</span> and a “long” railway trip,
insisted that he could not sing <span class='it'>Tristan</span> the following day
in Pittsburgh without endangering his voice. But if I
would pay him five hundred dollars extra he would take
the great risk of injuring his voice and would agree to
sing. Naturally I was furious and told him politely but
firmly what I thought of him, and then sent for my other
tenor and told him that his rival was trying to blackmail
me and I suggested to him that if he would sing <span class='it'>Tristan</span>
for me in spite of his having sung <span class='it'>Lohengrin</span> the night
before, I would consider it as a performance outside of
his guarantee. Needless to say he jumped at the opportunity
of gaining an extra six hundred dollars and at the
same time “putting one over” on his hated rival. I then
went to bed and slept soundly on a pillow made downy
by a deed well done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning I received word from tenor No. 1 that
he had changed his mind, was feeling very well, and
would sing, but I very haughtily told him that it was too
late and that I had already made other arrangements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far this story seems a wonderful example of virtue
triumphant and vice defeated, but, alas, life’s problems
do not always work out that way! During the day my
dramatic soprano who was to have sung <span class='it'>Isolde</span> became
hoarse and the opera had to be changed, so that all my
carefully reared structure of righteousness and meting
out of punishment to the guilty one fell to the ground
with a very dull thud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is only one of many such instances, some of them
childish and others really wicked. But the most unmoral
thing about it is that when the culprits were great artists,
no matter how much they enraged me by their
wickedness, after they had appeared again triumphantly
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
as <span class='it'>Siegfried</span> or <span class='it'>Isolde</span> I would often become so enthusiastic
over their work that their slate would be washed
clean and I was ready to forgive them again and to begin
anew. Such is the power of art, and a grateful public
will always be willing to remember only the artistic uplift
which they have received from the artist and forget
his personal weaknesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally my strictures apply only to certain of the
singers. There were many who were always honorable
in their relations with me. Among the most devoted of
the members of my company I should mention the singers
of the chorus. Many of these had been at the Metropolitan
in the German opera days. Their salaries were
small, but if one of their number fell ill or suffered other
misfortune, none so quick as they to help, and they always
endured the hardships of travel with great good
humor and unfailing courtesy and decency toward me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among other reasons that impelled me finally to give
up the opera was the realization how comparatively
seldom absolute artistic perfection can be obtained at a
stage performance. There are so many people concerned
in it that it is almost impossible always to obtain a cast
which is thoroughly satisfactory, and one “second rater”
can spoil an ensemble. Still another problem was the
question of stage illusion. I gave this a great deal of attention
and study, and spent a great deal of money on scenery
and lighting. I examined the best inventions in this direction
in the opera-houses of Germany and imported
many of them. I was the first to bring over the very
clever swimming-machines used in Dresden by the Rhine
Maidens in “Rhinegold.” But Wagner’s demands on the
stage are so extraordinary that a real illusion is not often
possible. His music excites the imagination and is often
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
all sufficient. One can see the glorious flames crackling
and burning around the sleeping <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> when one
hears an orchestra of a hundred playing the music of the
“Fire Charm,” but how seldom does a stage performance
enhance this illusion! The <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> may be too big and
too fat, or the light of the flames may too clearly show
that the scenery is but painted canvas and pasteboard
after all, and our sophisticated eyes know only too well
how the plumber’s steam-pipes convey the steam that is
intended to simulate the smoke of the flames from the
boiler in the cellar. It sometimes seemed to me, after
striving in vain to carry out Wagner’s ideal of a union of
all the arts in order to produce a new and perfect art
form (the “music-drama”), as if this great genius had
really committed a gigantic mistake, and as if the very
artistic illusion and semblance of verity was destroyed
by the scenic paraphernalia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course there were performances over which a happy
star seemed to shine and which now and then gave us
complete satisfaction and happiness. But the static
quality of scenery became to me more and more a hindrance
to an imagination ready to soar on the wings of the
music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I carried on my opera company for another year in
conjunction with Mr. Charles Ellis, and then definitely
resolved to cease all managerial activities and to confine
myself absolutely to purely musical work. It took me
some time to arrive at this decision, as opera work has
also a very fascinating side, and I had made real friends
with many of my singers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had found Ellis to be a delightful partner. He had
had years of experience as manager of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, and his equable temperament and fairmindedness
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
had made him many friends. I sold to him
my share in all our scenery, costumes, and properties as
he wished to continue operatic work with Madame Melba
as his principal star, and I agreed to conduct a limited
number of Wagner performances for him in Philadelphia
during the following season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the four hectic years I had spent with the Damrosch
Opera Company I was glad of such an opportunity
to take stock of the past and cogitate on the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wife and I rented the old Butler place in Westchester
County, near Hartsdale—a lovely old mansion
surrounded by dark pine forests and with the little Bronx
River trickling through—and there we spent most of the
winter until May. I wrote a violin sonata there and enjoyed
the tranquillity of a life freed from operatic worries
and excitements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1900 I was once more tempted into the field of opera,
but this time it carried with it no managerial or financial
responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maurice Grau was at that time the lessee of the Metropolitan
Opera House. Abbey had died a few years before
and the directors, who had gradually realized that it
was Grau who had been the real “man behind the gun,”
gave him and a small group of financial backers the lease
of the Metropolitan Opera House. Grau invited me to
return to the Metropolitan as conductor for the Wagner
operas. He had at that time a strong group of Wagnerian
singers. At the head was the inimitable Jean de Reszke,
together with his brother Edouard. Grau had also taken
over from my company Madame Ternina, David Bispham,
and Madame Gadski. The latter had been a member
of the Damrosch Opera Company for the entire four
years of its existence. She was only twenty-three when I
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>
first engaged her, possessor of a lovely voice, and an indefatigable
worker. There were weeks on our Western
tours when she would appear on five successive days as
<span class='it'>Elsa</span>, <span class='it'>Elizabeth</span>, <span class='it'>Sieglinde</span>, and <span class='it'>Eva</span>. She was a hard
student and her voice developed more and more. During
her last year with me she added the “Walküre” and
“Siegfried” <span class='it'>Brunhildes</span> to her repertoire, studying them
with me, partly on the trains while travelling, partly in
the hotels and theatres of the various cities we visited.
When she went into the Grau Company, she added the
“Götterdämmerung” <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> and <span class='it'>Isolde</span>, thereby completing
the entire circle of Wagner soprano parts, except
<span class='it'>Kundry</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean de Reszke, like Lilli Lehmann, turned to the Wagnerian
rôles in the high noon of his operatic career. He
had made his fame in the French-Italian operas, but Wagner
attracted him irresistibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember that during one of the seasons of the Damrosch
Opera Company we were playing in Boston at the
Boston Theatre while the Abbey and Grau Company
were performing in the huge Mechanic’s Hall. Jean and
Edouard de Reszke attended one of my “Siegfried” performances
with Max Alvary in the title-rôle. They applauded
their colleague vociferously, and after the performance
Jean lamented to me that he was compelled to
sing nothing but <span class='it'>Fausts</span> and <span class='it'>Romeos</span> and <span class='it'>Werthers</span>, while
it was the ambition of his life to sing Wagner. The
memory of his extraordinary impersonations of these rôles
later on is too vivid to need comment from me. Illness
kept him away from America one year, and when he returned
I was again at the Metropolitan as conductor of
the Wagner operas. It was a joy to work with this man.
Great artist, courteous gentleman, and generous colleague,
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
and (what is most valuable to a conductor) indefatigable
at rehearsals. His return was like the triumphant
entry of a victorious monarch. He was a marvellous mimic,
and used to give us delicious imitations of
the various artists of the company coming into his dressing-room
to offer their congratulations after his first reappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Reszke would first depict the French tenor colleague
who in polite, reserved, and even patronizing accents
would say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vraiment, mon cher, vous-avez chanté très bien ce
soir, très bien, je vous assure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then would come the German barytone in a double-breasted
frock coat and punctiliously polite manner,
saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Erlauben Sie mir, Herr de Reszke, Ihnen meine grosse
Hochachtung aus zu drücken für den wirklich ausgezeichneten
Genuss den Sie uns heute Abend bereitet
haben.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was followed by the Italian barytone, who would
rush in impulsively and, kissing Jean on both cheeks,
would exclaim:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Caro mio, carissimo!” followed by a flood of Italian
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the real climax of the scene. Enter the electrician
who, thrusting a “horny hand of toil” into that of
de Reszke, would exclaim in real “Yankee” accents:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jean, you done fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edouard de Reszke, the huge bass brother with the
heart of a child and an imperturbable good nature, was
an equally good mimic. But his wonderful stories and
impersonations were of a decidedly Rabelaisian character
and will not bear repetition here.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
With these two well-corseted but un-Corsican brothers,
Madame Ternina or Madame Nordica, Madame Schumann-Heink,
and David Bispham we gave performances
of “Tristan” which came as near perfection as I ever
hope to witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Nordica had been for years a so-called
“utility” singer at the Metropolitan. She had been
trained in the French-Italian repertoire, and while her
voice was beautiful she had not yet achieved full stardom,
perhaps because she was American born and lacked the
European cachet, which at that time was more important
than it is to-day. She was not by nature musically gifted
and was able to learn a rôle only by the hardest and most
painful work of endless repetition and rehearsals. But
her ambition was boundless—she bided her time and,
like Lilli Lehmann, gradually worked herself into the
Wagner repertoire. Realizing its advertising value, she
offered herself to Madame Cosima Wagner for the
“Lohengrin” production at Bayreuth. She meekly accepted
every instruction given her there during the
months of preparations, no matter how meticulous or
artificial some of them seemed to her, and the success
which she obtained there launched her successfully on
her career as a Wagner singer. I trained her in the
<span class='it'>Brunhildes</span> as well as <span class='it'>Isolde</span> and was amazed at the way in
which she achieved through hard work what nature gives
to others overnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember her coming to Philadelphia to sing “Götterdämmerung”
with my company. She arrived the
previous day and I found her still very uncertain in the
second act, which is rhythmically very difficult. I sat
down with her at eight o’clock that evening and we went
over that second act again and again until about four
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
o’clock in the morning. It was ghastly but wonderful.
At ten <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. M.</span> I gave her an orchestral rehearsal and in the
evening she sang the rôle with perfect assurance and with
hardly a mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One performance of “Tristan” which we gave with the
Grau Company in Baltimore at the Lyric Theatre, which
has perhaps the best acoustics of any auditorium in the
country, still stays vividly in my memory. At the close
we were so elated that all concerned kissed each other
ecstatically after the last curtain fell. Those are the rare
moments that make one forget the many times perfection
in opera seems impossible to attain.</p>

<h3>ARTISTS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I have written elsewhere of my first visit to Europe
after my father’s death, when the directors of the Metropolitan
Opera House made me assistant to the director,
Edmund C. Stanton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had gone over to engage German singers for the coming
season, and Emil Fischer, bass from the Dresden
Royal Opera, was one of those whose contract I had
ready for Stanton’s signature when he arrived a month
later. Emil Fischer had become discontented with his
life in Dresden and in signing with us broke his contract
with the Royal Opera, and according to an arrangement
which all the directors of the various German opera-houses
had with each other, this prevented him from
ever again appearing on the stage of a German opera-house.
He remained in America and became one of the
main props of the Metropolitan Opera House Company,
and later on of my Damrosch Opera Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was a beautiful <span class='it'>basso cantante</span> of great range
and vibrancy. His tone production was perfect, and his
powers as an impersonator equalled his singing. He will
always remain in my memory as the greatest <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span>
I have ever heard. He imbued the part with a nobility
and at the same time with a delightful humor that no
other <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span> has quite equalled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a man he was a delicious mixture of childishness,
vanity, generosity, and kindliness, but I do not think
that any emotions of life touched him very deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
In dress he was always extremely fastidious, inclining
toward a somewhat flamboyant love of extremes. His
neckties were rather vivid, his trousers perhaps a shade
lighter in gray than the most harmonious taste would demand.
He had a highly developed chest, of which he was
so inordinately proud that he never buttoned the upper
part of his waistcoat, as if to demonstrate that no waistcoat
could be cut large enough to encompass his manly
proportions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the value of money, as far as saving it was concerned,
he had no idea, and his constant effort was directed
toward hiding from his wife the fact that he had
money in his pocket. She was a buxom lady somewhat
older than himself who, in her youth, had been a <span class='it'>tragedienne</span>
in one of the smaller German court theatres. She
must have played such parts as <span class='it'>Medea</span>, and continued the
rather exaggerated and gloomy articulation of her words
into private life and through all the years that followed
her final exit from the stage. Whenever she told me: “My
Emil is not well to-day. I have made for him a plate of
beef soup into which I have boiled four pounds of beef,”
it boomed upon my ears like Shakespearian blank verse
or like a Greek tragedy of Sophocles. I think that she
annoyed Emil excessively, and that he was happiest when
he could get away from her no doubt excellent control
and find enjoyment among a circle of boon companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recall that when he was a member of my opera company
I paid him two hundred and fifty dollars an appearance,
with about twelve appearances a month guaranteed,
but he insisted that in the written contract I should make
it only two hundred dollars an appearance and give him
the other fifty in cash. He used this subtle method in
order to have about six hundred dollars a month spending
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
money of which his wife should know nothing. It was I
who had to endure the complaints from her, which ran
something like this: “I do not know why my Emil is so
badly paid while all the others get these enormous salaries.
My Emil sings better than any of them and he
has to be content with only two hundred dollars an appearance!”
And I would sit by feeling very guilty, and
yet, from that horrid loyalty which one man has for another,
not daring to exculpate myself by condemning him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one time in Chicago I accompanied him into a
haberdasher’s shop as he wished to buy a necktie. He
selected one the price of which was two dollars and a
half, and then superbly handed the astonished clerk a
five-dollar bill, saying grandiloquently: “You may keep
the change!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a great gourmet, and every now and then would
give a banquet at his house to his fellow artists, with interminable
courses and all manner of wines. Needless to
say he did not save anything from his earnings and there
came years, as he grew older and his voice left him, when
he had to turn to teaching. But he never changed his
habits and his appearance was just as carefully gotten up
as in former years. Finally came the time when he was
really in want, and I assisted Mr. Flagler, who was also
an old admirer of his, in getting up a benefit for him at
the Metropolitan Opera House. The directors very generously
gave the use of the house, many of the stockholders
bought their boxes, and the climax of the performance
was the appearance of dear old Fischer in his
greatest rôle of <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span> in the third act of “Die
Meistersinger.” A very good sum was realized with
which we bought an annuity for him. He was then, I believe,
seventy-four (his wife had died several years before),
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
and a ten-year annuity seemed to us the best way
of taking care of him without giving him an opportunity
to squander his money. He was delighted, and the first
thing he did on the strength of his new wealth was to
marry a young lady from the chorus, who, however, I
believe took excellent care of him until he died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the second year of the Damrosch Opera Company,
while we were in St. Louis and just the day before
Fischer was to sing <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span>, a telegram arrived
saying that his wife was very ill and was not expected to
live more than eight hours. Frau Alvary insisted that I
must make him go to New York to see her. He did not
want to go. He had not been on particularly pleasant
terms with her, he knew he could not arrive in time to
see her alive, and besides that he knew also that I had
no substitute to sing <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span> for him and that the
cancellation of the opera would cost me about five thousand
dollars. But Frau Alvary, who seemed quite ready
to insist on reasons of sentiment when her own purse
was not concerned, so bedevilled us both that I finally,
being still young and sentimental, decided that he should
go. I was therefore compelled to change the programme
at the last moment and to substitute single acts from
different operas, which, of course, was a very costly change,
as the audience in St. Louis had especially looked forward
to the first performance of “Die Meistersinger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of a possible change of programme had
travelled fast, and on that morning I received a visit
from a young singer, Gerhardt Stehmann, who a year
before had come to St. Louis with a little German opera
company which had promptly stranded, leaving him
without a job. He had, however, continued to live there,
acting in occasional German plays and teaching Latin,
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
as he was a man of excellent education. He asked me if
I could not give him a place in my company. I found him
to be an excellent singer, but above all a man musically
so gifted that he could learn an entire rôle in a few hours.
He learned the entire third act of “Die Meistersinger”
overnight, so that I was able at least to present that
to my St. Louis audience. I immediately engaged him
as a permanent member of my company, and he remained
with me until its dissolution three years later,
when he returned to Germany and was grabbed by
Mahler for the Imperial opera at Vienna, where he has
been ever since. He literally knew and sang every bass
and barytone part in the Wagner operas and music dramas.
His <span class='it'>Beckmesser</span> in “Die Meistersinger” was a masterpiece
of delineation, and no one could depict this nasty,
carping, jealous, and vain person in so convincing a
fashion as he. But if the exigencies of the moment demanded
it, he was just as able to sing <span class='it'>Hans Sachs</span>, <span class='it'>Pogner</span>,
<span class='it'>Kothner</span>, or any other of the good old burghers of
that opera. In “Tannhäuser” he was equally at home
as <span class='it'>Landgrave</span> or <span class='it'>Biterolf</span>, but his most remarkable feat
of learning a part quickly was performed in New York
one spring. The German composer, Xaver Scharwenka,
was at that time living in New York as piano virtuoso
and teacher. He had, years before, composed an opera
which he was anxious to perform, and William Steinway
and others asked me if I would let him have my opera
company for this purpose, so that he could conduct it
himself at an extra performance. I agreed and a good
cast was selected. The tenor part was to have been sung
by Ernest Krauss, a rather conceited heroic tenor who,
not finding the part to his liking, pleaded hoarseness only
the day before the performance. There was, of course,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
no substitute, and it seemed as if the performance would
have to be cancelled, which would have been a cruel experience
for the composer. To my astonishment Stehmann
appeared and said very simply: “Give me the part
and I will learn it for to-morrow night.” When I interposed,
“But this is a tenor part and you are a bass barytone,”
he answered: “Give it to me. I think I can transpose
a few of the high notes and can at least save the performance.”
Scharwenka, overjoyed, gave him the part
and he sang and acted it the following evening without a
mistake—a truly remarkable feat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grew very fond of him, not only because of his musicianly
qualities but also because as a man he was so simple
and honorable, and I was glad to hear later on that
he had made an excellent position for himself in Vienna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This summer of 1922, I visited Vienna again after many,
many years. I felt that the war should be completely
over for us and that we should seek in every way to re-establish
cultural relations with our former enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found Stehmann still at the Vienna opera, now no
longer called Kaiserliche but Staats-Oper. It was a joy to
see him again, but the war had brought to him also great
misfortune! He told me that from his savings, while a
member of my opera company and from subsequent
savings in Vienna, he had bought a house with several
acres of land in the Austrian Tyrols. With tears in his
eyes he showed me photographs of this property. The
house was charmingly situated in a picturesque valley
with the Tyrolean Alps beyond. After the war this territory
was taken over by Italy; and that government,
wishing to drive out the Austrians and settle the land
with Italians, had compelled Stehmann to “sell” his property
for a sum fixed by them. He had no choice and the
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
price which he received amounted to about thirty-seven
thousand five hundred kronen, which happened to be the
amount I had paid that morning for a pair of shoes—at
the present valuation about three dollars and seventy
cents! The Poles claim that Bismarck pursued the same
policy in Posnia when Prussia endeavored to suppress
Polish national aspirations, by forcing them to sell their
lands to the Prussian Junkers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sorry on arriving in Vienna not to see once more
the venerable old singer, Marianne Brandt, but she had
died, aged eighty-four, during the previous winter. In
1884-85 she had been one of the main props of my father’s
inaugural German opera season; and her emotional
intensity in “Fidelio” and as the mother in “Le Prophète”
had made a deep impression on our public. Nature
had not endowed her with beauty of face or figure,
and she always insisted: “I have been a virtuous woman
all my life because I am so ugly that no man would ever
look at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wagner had invited her to Bayreuth to sing the part
of <span class='it'>Kundry</span> in “Parsifal,” but whether because of her lack
of beauty or because, as she thought, of terrible intrigues
on the part of Madame Materna, she sang the rôle only
once and always remained exceedingly jealous of Madame
Materna, whose rather amplitudinous charms, she insisted,
had completely hypnotized Wagner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She simply adored my father and his single-minded
idealism, and the spirituality of his character appealed to
her to such an extent that she was willing to undergo any
amount of work and to sing any rôle which he wanted of
her, whether it were a star part or one of the Valkyries
in “Walküre.” After his death she was inconsolable, and
always went on the anniversary to Woodlawn Cemetery
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
to deposit a wreath on his grave. She also sought to
demonstrate her veneration for his memory by helping
me in every way possible, both as superb artist and as one
well versed in the practical side of operatic life through
years of experience in Vienna and at the Royal Opera in
Berlin. She always called me “Mein Sohn,” and her
encouragement and faith in my future as a musician during
many trying times can never be forgotten by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a delightful sense of humor, but also a very
quick temper, and I remember her telling me one day
that she had received a notice from the New York Post-Office
Department that a registered letter was awaiting
her down in the General Post-Office at City Hall. She
went there and inquired at the proper window for her
letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the official, “we have it here. Have you
got some document to prove that you are Marianne
Brandt?—a letter, a bank-book, or a passport?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have none of these things, but I am Marianne
Brandt and I want that letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, madame, but the rules are strict, and you
will have to bring some one to identify you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Brandt was in a state of high indignation.
“You will not give me the letter? I will prove to you
that I am Marianne Brandt!” And then she proceeded
with full voice to sing the great cadenza from her principal
aria in “Le Prophète.” Her glorious voice echoed
and re-echoed through the vaulted corridors of the post-office.
Men came running from all sides to find out what
had happened and finally the agitated official handed her
the letter, saying: “Here is your letter, but for God’s
sake be quiet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She finally retired from the stage to her old home in
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Vienna and gave of her art with both hands to a group
of devoted pupils. During the war I heard from one of
them that, owing to the destitute condition existing in
Vienna, she was in real want, but she promptly returned
the check we sent her and in a very sweet letter addressed
as usual to “Mein Sohn” assured me that she
did not need any money, that she did not expect to live
much longer, and that she thought she could hold out
without receiving any alms from her friends. We did
succeed, however, in sending her food which she shared
with others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the singers whom I engaged for the Metropolitan
Opera House during my first visit to Germany
and who afterward achieved great fame was Max Alvary,
a young lyric tenor at the Weimar Ducal Opera
House. He was the son of the well-known German
painter, Andreas Achenbach, of good education, gentlemanly
bearing, and a refined artistic taste. He was also
exceedingly good looking. As a singer he was very uneven,
although he had studied with the Italian master,
Lamperti. At first we paid him only a hundred dollars
a night, but after he had sung minor rôles for a few months
Anton Seidl chose him to create the part of <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>, and
in that rôle he made a success so instantaneous as to
place him immediately in the front rank of German opera-singers.
No one else has given <span class='it'>Siegfried</span> such an atmosphere
of boyish innocence and picturesque beauty. The
women, bless them, simply worshipped him, from the
sixteen-year-old schoolgirl to the matron of mature and
more than mature age, and this success repeated itself
when he appeared as <span class='it'>Siegfried</span> in Germany, Austria,
and England. He made a great deal of money and spent
it lavishly. His armor and helmet in “Lohengrin” were
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
specially made for him out of silver after a design which
he had drawn himself. The stuffs for his costumes were
often specially woven for him. He reached the climax of
his career when he was chosen by Cosima Wagner to sing
<span class='it'>Tannhäuser</span> and <span class='it'>Tristan</span> at Bayreuth. At that time this
shrine for the Wagnerite had already become, under the
guiding and autocratic hand of the widow of Wagner, a
highly artificial product. I saw several of these performances
and was frankly amazed at the apparent degeneration
since the days of Wagner. Alvary, who had a great
sense of humor, gave most entertaining descriptions of the
rehearsals, and how, for instance, in slavish imitation
of certain rhythms in the orchestra, <span class='it'>Tannhäuser</span> and
<span class='it'>Wolfram</span> had to execute a kind of minuet opposite each
other in order to fill in the instrumental introduction before
<span class='it'>Wolfram</span> begins his famous plea to <span class='it'>Tannhäuser</span>:
“Als du im kühnen Sange uns bestrittest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1891 Carnegie Hall, which had been
built by Andrew Carnegie as a home for the higher musical
activities of New York, was inaugurated with a music
festival in which the New York Symphony and Oratorio
Societies took part. In order to give this festival a
special significance, I invited Peter Iljitsch Tschaikowsky,
the great Russian composer, to come to America
and to conduct some of his own works. In all my many
years of experience I have never met a great composer so
gentle, so modest—almost diffident—as he. We all loved
him from the first moment—my wife and I, the chorus,
the orchestra, the employees of the hotel where he lived,
and of course the public. He was not a conductor by
profession and in consequence the technic of it, the
rehearsals and concerts, fatigued him excessively; but he
knew what he wanted and the atmosphere which emanated
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
from him was so sympathetic and love-compelling
that all executants strove with double eagerness to divine
his intentions and to carry them out. The performance
which he conducted of his Third Suite, for instance, was
admirable, although it is in parts very difficult; and as he
was virtually the first of great living composers to visit
America, the public received him with jubilance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came often to our house, and, I think, liked to
come. He was always gentle in his intercourse with
others, but a feeling of sadness seemed never to leave
him, although his reception in America was more than
enthusiastic and the visit so successful in every way that
he made plans to come back the following year. Yet he
was often swept by uncontrollable waves of melancholia
and despondency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following year in May I went to England with
my wife, and received an invitation from Charles Villiers
Stanford, then professor of music at Cambridge, to visit
the old university during the interesting commencement
exercises at which honorary degrees of Doctor of Music
were to be given to five composers of five different countries—Saint-Saëns
of France, Boito of Italy, Grieg of Norway,
Bruch of Germany, and Tschaikowsky of Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proceedings proved highly interesting and enjoyable.
As each recipient of the honor stepped forward in
his doctor’s robe, the orator addressed him in a discourse
of orotund Latin phrases, praising his many virtues and
accomplishments, and these phrases were constantly interrupted
by the clatter of facetious remarks and requests
from the undergraduates in the balcony, all this
according to old-established custom. Sometimes the uproar
became so great that the presiding officer had to
arise and demand “Silentium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
Among the other recipients of degrees on that occasion
was Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, Baron of Kandahar,
who, in his scarlet uniform beneath his doctor’s robe, received
of course the most uproarious welcome. At that
time no one dreamed that twenty-three years later he
would go around England uttering solemn warning against
the inevitability of war with Germany and bidding England
gird on her sword and prepare, only to be laughed
at as an alarmist and publicly reprimanded by politicians
for seeking to arouse such feeling against a “friendly
power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening a great banquet was given in the refectory
of the college, and by good luck I was placed next
to Tschaikowsky. He told me during the dinner that
he had just finished a new symphony which was different
in form from any he had ever written. I asked him in
what the difference consisted and he answered: “The
last movement is an adagio and the whole work has a
programme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do tell me the programme,” I demanded eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “that I shall never tell. But I shall
send you the first orchestral score and parts as soon as
Jurgenson, my publisher, has them ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We parted with the expectation of meeting again in
America during the following winter, but, alas, in October
came the cable announcing his death from cholera,
and a few days later arrived a package from Moscow containing
the score and parts of his Symphony No. 6, the
“Pathétique.” It was like a message from the dead. I
immediately put the work into rehearsal and gave it its
first performance in America on the following Sunday.
Its success was immediate and profound. We gave it
many repetitions that winter and I have played it since
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
in concerts all over the United States. Other orchestras
have cultivated it with equal assiduity, and in fact for
me the time came several years ago when I cried a halt
and let the work lie fallow, as it had evidently been overplayed
and its high-strung rhythms had excited the nerves
of executants and audiences so often that they were in
danger of being overstrained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ignace Paderewski made his first appearance in America
in 1891, and I conducted his first five orchestral concerts.
He came under the auspices of Steinway and Sons,
and they told me that the gross receipts for the first concert
were only five hundred dollars! His playing as well
as his personality, however, immediately took our public
by storm, and I do not think that since the days of Franz
Liszt there has been any other travelling virtuoso in
whom the man was as fascinating as the artist. People
who have wondered how it was possible for him when
the Great War began to throw himself so fully equipped
at every point into the struggle to achieve national unity
for Poland, do not realize that he was, consciously or
unconsciously, preparing himself for just this opportunity
all his life. He had always dreamed of a united
and independent Poland. He knew the history of his
people, their strength, and their weakness. It is said that
one day he played before the Czar who, congratulating
him, expressed his pleasure that a “Russian” should have
achieved such eminence in his art. Paderewski answered:
“I am a Pole, your Majesty,” and, needless to say, was
never again invited to play in Russia. His mind is one
of the most extraordinary I have ever come in contact
with. All the world knows what he has achieved in
music—his inspired interpretations, his prodigious memory,
and the subtle range of colors of his musical palette,
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
but not so many know of his interest in literature,
philosophy, and history, and it took the Great War to
demonstrate that as orator and statesman he ranks as
high as musician. I heard him make a speech on Poland
during the Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 before an
audience of ten thousand, in which he gave so eloquent a
survey of Poland’s history and of her needs and rights,
as to rouse the people to a frenzy of enthusiasm, and I
am convinced that Poland owes her national existence
to-day to his statesmanship and to the sympathy which
his personality created among the Allies at the Versailles
Conference. I believe that Colonel House pronounced
him to be the greatest statesman of the Conference, and
it was only the cynical Clemenceau who said to him:
“M. Paderewski, you were the greatest pianist in the
world and you have chosen to descend to our level. What
a pity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he first came to America, his English was very
incomplete but even then he demonstrated his grasp
of it in unmistakable fashion. One evening he, my
wife, and I dined at the house of very dear mutual
friends, Mr. and Mrs. John E. Cowdin, in Gramercy Park.
Cowdin had all his life been an enthusiastic polo player,
and after dinner Paderewski and I admired some handsome
silver trophies that he had won and that were
placed in the dining-room. I said: “You see the difference
between you and Johnny is that he wins his prizes
in playing polo while you win yours in playing solo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zat is not all ze difference!” Paderewski immediately
exclaimed in his gentle Polish accents. “I am a poor
Pole playing solo, but Johnny is a dear soul playing
polo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is highly gifted as a composer, and besides a very
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
interesting and spiritual symphony I remember with
keen pleasure his opera “Manru,” which Maurice Grau
brought out at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1902
and which I conducted. I cannot remember ever having
worked harder toward achieving a successful première.
The orchestral parts, which had been copied in Germany
in a great hurry, arrived so full of mistakes that the first
rehearsals were an agony of constant stopping and correcting,
and these corrections went on during the entire
time of preparation, and I believe that I still found two
inaccuracies at the rehearsal just preceding the general
rehearsal. Again and again I took some of the worst
parts home and worked late into the night going through
them meticulously myself, and comparing them with the
orchestral score in an endeavor to bring order out of
chaos. The opera received a warm welcome, but the
libretto was lacking somewhat in dramatic interest; and
the music, with all its genuine charm and warmth, was
not able to successfully combat this lack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think that if Paderewski had been willing to sacrifice
his marvellous career as a piano virtuoso (and that would
have been a great sacrifice) he would have become one
of the greatest composers of our time. It does not seem
easy to unite the two careers, as they are essentially at
war with each other. Liszt, the only man with whom I
can compare Paderewski, recognized this fact, and at
forty years of age resolutely turned his back on virtuosodom,
with its life in the public glare, its excitements,
crowds, and emoluments, in order to devote himself to
composition. He settled in the little town of Weimar,
living a life of poverty, and never again touched the
piano for personal gain. Only now and then he would
play in public in order to gather funds for the Beethoven
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
monument in Bonn or for some great charity. And yet
it is universally conceded that even he stopped too late
and that, great as is the sum total of his contributions to
creative art, he would have been still greater and able
to express himself more genuinely if he had never been
“the greatest pianist of his generation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to define the charm with which the artists
of Poland seem to be imbued almost beyond any other
race. It is more than a social gift. It is not the result of
calculation but seems to be a combination of kindliness
of heart and good breeding. Madame Marcella Sembrich
has it to a supreme degree, also Jean and Edouard de
Reszke, also Tim and Joe Adamowski, Paul Kochanski,
and my old friend Alexander Lambert, and if the new
state of Poland were composed only of such of the Polish
elect as I have just mentioned it would soon become the
ideal republic of the world. On the other hand, a country
composed exclusively of musicians might not make a
contented population, as it is well known that we need
an audience to listen to us, and musicians, rightly or
wrongly, have the reputation of never being willing to
listen to each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not, however, mean to imply that the Poles are
the exclusive possessors of personal charm. For instance,
I do not know of any man who has it in greater degree
than my old friend Charles Martin Loeffler, who was
born in Alsace, received his musical education in France,
was violinist in the private orchestra of a Russian grand
duke in Nice, and, at the age of sixteen, came to America.
My father immediately became very fond of him, and
on Sunday afternoons, when we always had chamber-music
at home in which my father played first violin
and Sam Franko second, Martin Loeffler would play the
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
viola. I liked him immensely and our friendship has
lasted through the years. Our birthdays are on the same
day, and we are almost of an age, as he is only a year
older. When Higginson formed the Boston Orchestra
under George Henschel, Loeffler migrated to Boston and
became first violin and second concert master. At the
same time he continued his studies in composition, and
has since become one of our foremost American composers.
For years he has lived as a gentleman farmer in
Medfield, Massachusetts. His compositions are few and
far between, but all of them have the same aristocratic
conception, refinement, and original orchestration, such
as a man can write who has spent a great part of his life
in the orchestra and knows its literature and possibilities.
His letters, exquisitely penned, rank with those of
Eugene Ysaye, and that is high praise, as Ysaye is the
very prince of letter-writers. I venture to insert one of
Loeffler’s here because it treats of the first performance
of my opera, “Cyrano,” and because it is so whole-hearted
in its praise and so gentle but discerning in its criticisms
of the weak spots in my work.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Dear Walter:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>There was not a more amazed person amongst the audience last
Thursday than your old friend here. Having plowed away and
wallowed in storm for some time on my own One Act play, I know of
the difficulties, the doubts and hazards that one encounters in the
business of writing an opera. It is therefore with genuine admiration,
that I take off my hat and bow low to him, who could write the Score
of Cyrano. It is a masterly accomplishment of a treacherous task.
I did not see you on that exciting night; there having been some uncertainty
as to my being able to obtain a bed on the 1 o’clock train,
I finally had to give up the pleasure of going to your house. I press
your dear old hand now in spirit and in sincere admiration.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>Your orchestration sounded superbly. Your choruses blended
wonderfully with the orchestra and I have no doubt that with a
slight <span class='it'>remaniement</span> and <span class='it'>raccourcissement</span>, Cyrano will give great joy
to many in the future. I understand that you have already made
considerable cuts, still do I advise cutting out more. Four Acts
is a long proposition and some of the best things come in the last
Act. But the public begins to tire and can no longer thoroughly enjoy
the beauties of this Act. A few things have occurred to me besides.
In the scene on the balcony, I think it is a mistake to let
Cyrano say what Christian shall repeat to Roxane. Is this not what
happens in Act III, “How could I love you more,” etc? Would it
not be more expressive to let Cyrano prompt his stupid friend in
whispering and pantomimic gesture? Curiously enough, this scene
which one would have picked out as “made for an opera,” was perhaps
the least effective part of the Opera. After the climb to his
lady love, everything is again admirable.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Then, in the last act, I believe if you were to shorten Cyrano’s
delirium and hasten his death somewhat, you would strengthen and
heighten the final effect of your work. Cyrano dies hard and one
thinks of the nine-live-cat-death of Tristan! All this may only
seem long coming at the end of the preceding three intense hours.
There are really extraordinary effects in this final Act of yours and
one would like to look at such a score as yours. Probably, like all
telling things in this world, your effects are obtained through simplest
means.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The whole work is to me a delight on account of its real musicianship—a
work evolved from a highly sensitive, very intelligent brain,
that has absorbed and assimilated much, without imitating anybody
or anything.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>These are my first sincere impressions of your work, to which I
will add my sentiments. While the musician listened during the
hours of the performance, the friend in him was carefully kept apart.
When, however, the musician’s heart began beating more and more
warmly, the friend and the musician became again at one in their joy.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Here also arises the reflection: Where did you or where does anybody
acquire mastery? Do the gifted themselves really know what
they are doing and is Maeterlinck right when he makes Mélisande say
“Je ne sais pas ce que je sais”?</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='it'>A priori</span> I shall always say: There must be Opera in English—but
at present there cannot be, as nobody knows how to sing in it. The
performance however was admirable. Amato was superb and so
was the orchestra, chorus and old Herty! Hats off to him too!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Kindest regards to Mrs. Damrosch in which Elise joins me.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Believe me, dear Walter, as ever and more proudly than ever,</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Your friend</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Ch. M. Loeffler</span>.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1891 I was asked to give a concert for the Orthopædic
Hospital in which my friend, Mrs. John Hobart
Warren, was always much interested, and in casting
about for some sensational feature which would draw the
public I conceived the idea of having Eugene Ysaye and
Fritz Kreisler play the Bach concerto for two violins.
Ysaye was then at the very zenith of his career and
Kreisler had just come to America as a young violinist
of great attainments and charm, and still greater promise
for the future. The performance of the Bach concerto
proved all that I had hoped, and after the concert Ysaye
had supper with me at the old Delmonico’s in Madison
Square. Ysaye is not only a remarkable artist but one
of the most brilliant conversationalists I have met, and
during the supper he proceeded in the most fascinating
way to analyze himself and Kreisler. He said: “I have
arrived at the top and from now on there will be a steady
decrease of my powers. I have lived my life to the full
and burned the candle at both ends. For some time I
shall make up in subtlety of phrasing and nuance what
my technic as a violinist can no longer give, but
Kreisler is on the ascendant and in a short time he will
be the greater artist.” It is not for me to say whether
Ysaye’s prophecy has come true, but no one who has
heard him in his prime can forget his truly gigantic conception
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
of the Beethoven concerto, for instance, and the
mastery with which he poured out the golden flood of
his music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1909 I gave a Beethoven cycle at which I performed
all the Beethoven symphonies and other smaller
works of his in historical sequence. We had engaged
Ysaye to play the Beethoven Violin Concerto, but, to
my astonishment, he sent word only a week before that
he must first play a violin concerto by Vitali, as he had
to get his fingers into proper condition before playing
the Beethoven. I remonstrated with him and explained
to him that in a Beethoven cycle I could not possibly
give a concerto by Vitali, even to oblige Ysaye, and suggested
that he play the Vitali concerto to himself in the
greenroom before the concert, but he refused to accept
this amendment and I was ever so reluctantly compelled
to cancel his appearance in the cycle. This caused a
coolness between us which lasted several years and which
I regretted exceedingly. But time is a great peacemaker.
We happened to meet again quite casually a few years
later, and by tacit consent this little contretemps was
completely buried and we are as good friends as of yore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the most important and interesting great
musician of France whom I have known was Camille
Saint-Saëns, whom I met in 1908 when he came to America
on a concert tour. He was at that time seventy years
of age. His extraordinary vitality and the fluency of his
playing amazed us all, and America outdid itself to honor
this venerable <span class='it'>grand maître</span>. I had the great pleasure of
conducting all of his concerts in New York at which he
played his five piano concertos, an extraordinary feat for
a man of his age. We had heard so many stories from
French musicians of his “nasty temper” at rehearsals and
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
his caustic comments on this or that phrasing in his symphonies
or concertos that we were all very agreeably
disappointed in finding him genial, cheerful, and grateful
for what we were able to give him. He even insisted on
playing the organ himself at my performance of his
Symphony No. 3, which is dedicated to the memory of
Liszt. I have always considered this to be his greatest
work in that, with all the clarity of form and diction
which is a special characteristic of his style, there is also
a deep emotion which rises in the last movement to a
triumphant and thrilling climax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw him again in Paris during the war in the summer
of 1918, and reminded him of a visit which my father had
paid to him in 1876.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was not the first time I met your father,” he
quickly rejoined. “I remember very well meeting him
in Weimar in 1857 while I was visiting Liszt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1920 my second daughter, Gretchen, was to be
married to the son of Judge Finletter of Philadelphia.
The young people had met at Chaumont, France, where
Finletter had been stationed at General Headquarters
after the armistice and while Gretchen and her friend,
Mary Schieffelin, were there as war workers. My daughter
agreed enthusiastically with my suggestion that the
wedding should be in Paris after my European tour with
the orchestra was finished, and this to them highly important
event was carried out with great success on the
17th of July, the ceremony being solemnized at the
American church and the reception held at my hotel,
the “France et Choiseul,” in the Rue St. Honoré. As I
had come to this hotel for so many years, Monsieur
Mantel, the <span class='it'>directeur</span>, and all the employees from the
chef down, helped on the affair with an enthusiasm which
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
can only be found in a country like France, where all
festivals of family life are treated with tremendous importance.
All the reception-rooms down-stairs and the
greater part of the courtyard, which had been charmingly
framed in with laurel-trees and filled with inviting-looking
little tables, had been placed at our disposal. All the
employees of the house—including Leonie, François,
Pierre, Adolph, Theo, Félice, Madeleine, Michel, and
Louis, all of whom I had known during the war and even
before—wore large white boutonnières and ribbons in
honor of the occasion; and at four o’clock about a hundred
French and American friends began to arrive from the
ceremony at the church. Among these was my old friend
Madame Nellie Melba, who had come over from London
for the purpose, and “<span class='it'>le grand maître</span>” Camille Saint-Saëns,
whom all the hotel employees immediately recognized
and treated with great and fond deference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Saint-Saëns entered the courtyard he turned to me
and said, rather testily: “Mon cher ami, pourquoi est-ce
que vous n’avez-pas donné une de mes symphonies dans
un de vos concerts à Paris ce printemps?” For a moment
I was nonplussed what to answer. We had given
three concerts in Paris and I had devoted one to the
“Eroica” of Beethoven, and the other two to the César
Franck D Minor, the Mozart “Jupiter,” and the Dvořák
“New World” symphonies, but Albert Spalding, my soloist,
had played the Saint-Saëns Violin Concerto, so that his
name had been represented on our programmes. Suddenly
the right answer came to me: “Cher maître, don’t you
know that during the war I played your great Symphony
No. 3 at a gala concert on the Fête Nationale at the Salle
du Conservatoire for the benefit of the Croix Rouge, and
here is Monsieur Cortot who played the piano part and
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
here Mademoiselle Boulanger who played the organ.”
(Both of them were luckily standing by my side as Saint-Saëns
entered.) He was completely pacified and was
carried off in triumph to the buffet by a crowd of adoring
French musicians in order to offer him some refreshment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henri Casadesus told me afterward that when Saint-Saëns
arrived at the buffet he said: “I am thirsty.”
“Here is some champagne,” said Casadesus. “No.
That is too cold,” “Well, here is chocolate.” “No.
That is too hot,” whereupon he took the glass of champagne
and poured it into the chocolate and drank it
down with evident relish. Pretty good for a man then
eighty-two years of age!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Saint-Saëns had always preserved a great adoration
for Liszt, who had been one of the first musicians to befriend
him in his early days, and his admiration for Liszt’s
music had remained much greater than for that of Wagner.
In fact, during the war the majority of the French musicians
were furious at his chauvinistic attitude toward
Wagner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is told that when Saint-Saëns was still a very young
man he was calling on Liszt and the servant asked him to
wait a few minutes as Liszt was engaged in another room.
Saint-Saëns, seeing a manuscript orchestral score on the
piano, sat down and proceeded with his marvellous
musicianship to read and play it at sight, when suddenly
the door opened and Liszt and Wagner rushed in, amazed
at hearing the intricate harmonies of Wagner’s “Rheingold”
so marvellously reproduced. Wagner had just
brought the score to Liszt in order to show it to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the winter of 1920-21 I accepted the co-editorship
for a series of music readers to be used in our public
schools, and as I had agreed to invite a small group of
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
distinguished French and English composers to contribute
some songs for this publication, I requested Saint-Saëns
to honor us with two. He readily complied, and in the
summer of 1921 invited me to come to his apartment as
he had the songs all ready. When I called, he immediately
sat down at the piano and from his very neatly written
manuscript played them for me, begging me to observe
that he had made the accompaniment exceedingly simple
in order that “the American school-teachers should not
be too much puzzled by it.” For one of the songs composed
in honor of the aviators of the war, he had even
written the words himself, and for the other he had taken
words by La Fontaine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called at my hotel in August of 1921. He seemed to
me to have grown more feeble, but seeing on my piano
an edition of Beethoven’s piano sonatas, edited by von
Bülow, with which I always like to travel as I find the
playing of these sonatas very agreeable and restful between
the inevitable irritations of travel, Saint-Saëns
suddenly bristled up and became very angry at a certain
rather complicated fingering which Bülow had given to a
piano passage, as his fingers had not been adapted by nature
to rapid playing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the way it should be played,” said Saint-Saëns,
as he sat down at the piano and proceeded to let his
fingers, though still clad in gray lisle gloves, run up the
keys with incredible swiftness, like little gray mice. This
extreme dexterity never left him. I had heard him but
a month before at a musical given by Widor in his honor
and in which Saint-Saëns played the piano part in his
own “Septet with Trumpet.” His fingers literally ran
away with him, and every time there was a quick passage,
he accelerated the tempo to such an extent that the other
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
players simply had to scramble after him as best they
could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He died last winter at eighty-four years of age, and all
Paris, governmental, artistic, and scientific, united in giving
him imposing and significant obsequies. The respect
which the young men of France have for their old masters
is something exceedingly sympathetic to an American
observer. Whenever Saint-Saëns appeared among them
they would hover around with eager deference, flushing
with pride as he would say something to the one or
the other. In fact, Widor, who is perhaps ten years
younger than Saint-Saëns, always insisted on treating him
as if he, Widor, were a young, deferential schoolboy in
the presence of his great master. Indeed, they reserve
the words “<span class='it'>grand maître</span>” only for their very choicest men
of the arts and the learned professions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Lillian Nordica I made a joint tour through New
England, giving Wagner concerts. As she had by that
time arrived at true prima donna estate she had a private
car in which she lived and in which I also had a room.
The poor lady arrived on the first day with an attack of
bronchitis so acute that she could hardly speak. Her
voice sounded like the croak of a raven. I have never
seen any woman in such abject despair, walking up and
down the little dining-room of the car like a caged
tigress, every now and then touching a note on the upright
piano which had been placed therein, and trying her
voice. She was clad in a wrapper, and tears and misery
had ravaged her comely face so that it was hardly recognizable.
I, of course, thought that she would not sing
that evening, but at seven she disappeared into her room
and an hour later emerged clad in a magnificent toilet,
with her diamond tiara on the top of her head and her
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
face wonderfully made up. When she appeared before
her audience with whom she was an old favorite, her
manner had all the regal but smiling charm of yore. Her
voice? Well, that is another story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During that entire week this tragi-comedy would repeat
itself every day. Her bronchitis never left her, and
from my room I could hear this poor woman, as she entered
the dining-room, touch the piano furtively and try
to sing a few notes. It was agony, and I have hated private
cars ever since, and am quite content to occupy a
drawing-room or a berth in a regular sleeping-car when
I travel. It is certainly more cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we finally arrived in New York, where we expected
to give two Wagner concerts, lo and behold, the
clouds suddenly lifted. Nordica was her old self, and
while the diamond tiara could not have looked more
regal nor the smile have been more ingratiating than at
Worcester, Massachusetts, her voice had again regained its
old charm and the cry of the Valkyrie and <span class='it'>Isolde’s</span> Liebestod
brought back to the memory of her audiences the
happy days when Nordica, Schumann-Heink, and Jean
de Reszke had electrified them at the Metropolitan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Nordica was, however, not the only American
artist with whom I came into frequent professional contact
and who had achieved an eminence equal to that of
the best of Europe. David Bispham became a member
of my opera company in 1896. He came of an old Quaker
family in Philadelphia, into whose lives music had never
penetrated. How Bispham got his intense musical temperament
is one of those mysteries that the laws of neither
heredity nor environment can explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man of some means, and finding the local atmosphere
in which he lived uncongenial to his evident
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
artistic needs, he went to Europe. He had a vibrant
barytone voice, studied singing with Lamperti, and
gradually began to make successful appearances on the
stage, especially in England. In my company he achieved
especial successes as <span class='it'>Telramund</span>, <span class='it'>Kurvenal</span>, and <span class='it'>Beckmesser</span>,
also as <span class='it'>Roger Chillingworth</span> in my own opera on
Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter.” He adored a part in
which he could “act.” In fact, he sometimes overacted.
His musical memory, especially in his later years, was not
always to be relied on, but the more he forgot the words
the more intense his acting became, and as <span class='it'>Chillingworth</span>,
in which rôle he really never quite learned the text, he
fairly contorted his body in giving expression to the sinister
machinations and revengeful desires of that demon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a man he was of a singularly delightful, almost
childlike disposition. The things of this life rarely existed
for him as they really were. He saw them through
the glass of his own exuberant imagination. The mysterious,
the extraordinary, always fascinated him, and he
therefore often became the prey of designing people who
took easy advantage of his trusting nature. He was a
most generous colleague and more free from jealousy than
most operatic singers. Rehearsals, no matter how long,
were to him as the breath to his nostrils, and he would
often spend hours before his glass in the dressing-room
making up his face for some character part in close imitation
of a famous picture he had seen at the Uffizi in
Florence or the Royal Gallery in London. He loved to enact
a villain, but, on the other hand, his doglike devotion
to <span class='it'>Tristan</span> as <span class='it'>Kurvenal</span> often brought tears to our eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wife and I became very fond of him and, later on,
when he and I joined the Metropolitan Opera House
Company, again under Maurice Grau, we would often
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
take our meals together on the long Western trips to and
from California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was exceedingly irascible if servants did not carry
out his orders properly, and he would berate them in his
very resonant voice with a distinctness of utterance worthy
of the <span class='it'>Comédie Française</span>. One morning we were seated
at breakfast in the dining-car of our train when the colored
waiter brought him his coffee, which was so weak that
a drop of the so-called cream turned it a bluish gray.
“Take away that coffee!” Bispham thundered. “It is
not fit to drink. It is too weak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, sah!” expostulated gently the waiter. “Dat
coffee am all right. It’s de cream what’s too powerful
strong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time leather suitcases were just making their
first appearance and I had bought one and carried it
about with me. Bispham noticed it and said, in his extreme
Kensington English, which he had carefully acquired
over there: “Walter, that is a very nice bag you
have there. I think I will buy four of them, each one a
little smaller than the other, so that I can put them all
inside each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” I said, “David, aren’t you going to pack anything
else inside of those bags?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed David. “Walter, you are always
having your little joke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever my opera company came to Boston the supers,
when an extra group or crowd of knights or peasants,
etc., were necessary, were always taken from Harvard
University. This became a source of enormous revenue
to the doorkeeper at the stage entrance. Our stage-manager
paid him twenty-five cents for each super, but
he not only pocketed this money himself but charged the
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
students anywhere from fifty cents upward, according
to the popularity of the opera, for the privilege of hearing
it from the stage. In consequence we often had the most
wonderful athletic specimens that the ardent pursuit of
sport produces among college men, delighting our eyes as
the curtain rose, and the knights and nobles in the second
act of “Tannhäuser,” for instance, clad in magnificent
robes, would march in and solemnly listen to the
contest of song in the castle of the Landgrave of Thuringia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were not all athletes, and I remember one
real student among them. The curtain went up on the
first act of “Lohengrin” and, to my amazement as I
looked up from my conductor’s stand, I saw one of these
college boys, dressed in the armor and cloak of one of
King Henry’s knights, calmly standing at the foot of the
throne, large spectacles on his nose, busily following the
action of the opera from a libretto which he held in his
hand and close to his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another time a much more terrible occurrence took
place, but very much “behind the scenes.” I was in
Boston with the Grau Opera Company and, at a Saturday
matinée, “Carmen” was given with Madame Calvé
in the title rôle. I did not conduct that opera, and happened
to saunter on the stage after the third act. I
found the whole company in a state of only half-suppressed
merriment. While Madame A—— was singing
<span class='it'>Micaela’s</span> air on the stage, in which she implores <span class='it'>Don
Jose</span> to leave <span class='it'>Carmen</span> and return to his old mother, one
of these young wretches from Harvard had crept into
her dressing-room, and in order to have a triumphant
souvenir to hang up in his rooms at college he had stolen
her—&nbsp;No, not her stockings, but another important
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
part of her wearing apparel. Madame A——, on returning
to her dressing-room, had discovered the theft. Her
maid had told the wardrobe mistress, the wardrobe mistress
had told the stage carpenter, he had repeated it to
the stage-manager, and so forth and so on, the whole
company revelling in it, especially as Madame A—— was
herself of New England parentage and was considered
an exceptionally proper young person.</p>

<h3>ROMANCE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>“At last!” my readers will exclaim. “All these reminiscences
about musicians are well enough, but it is their
love-affairs that we are interested in. Think of Beethoven
and the Countess Giucciardi, of Berlioz and Miss Smithson,
of Liszt and the Countess d’Agoult, of Wagner
and Madame Wesendonck. Musicians are so romantic,
so different from ordinary men. They wear their hair
longer; they affect delightful eccentricities of conduct and
of clothes; the ordinary humdrum of life does not touch
them, and they live only in the higher and rarer atmosphere
of art and poetry.” Therefore woman, who is so
much more spiritual than man, sometimes thinks in her
unguarded moments that true happiness can only be
found by falling in love with an artist or, better still, having
him fall in love with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without venturing to place myself in the same category
as the great musicians mentioned above, I nevertheless
propose in this chapter to give a full and detailed account
of all my love-affairs—all, or at least of as many as
can be crowded into the confines of a chapter. I have
lived a great many years and my life, like that of other
artists, has been full to the brim of all kinds of interesting
and fascinating happenings, and in order that my readers
may gain a true picture I shall begin at the very beginning,
promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Terrible as it may seem, I have to confess at the outset
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
that I began my life as a gay <span class='it'>Lothario</span> at the tender age
of eight. My family were then living in Breslau, Silesia,
and the rear of the house in which our apartment was
situated opened on a large courtyard, upon which several
other houses faced. This courtyard naturally became
the playground of all the children who lived around
it. We were particularly intimate with one family, the
children of which consisted of an elder brother, already
in the university, who affected the appearance and manner
of the great German poet, Friedrich Schiller. He was
supposed to have great poetical talents, and it was darkly
rumored that he had already written two tragedies. I
was greatly in awe of him, but his younger brother, who
was a boy of my own age, was my classmate in school—the
gymnasium, as it was called. And then there was a
sister, little Lorchen, seven years of age, with blue eyes
and many blond curls. I had played with her and her
brother for several months before I suddenly discovered
that her curls were beautiful, like spun gold, and that
there was something particularly ingratiating in the blue
of her eyes. I had an intense desire to put my arms
around her, but, strange to say, the consciousness of this
filled me with such anger that instead of giving way to it
I took the first opportunity to slap this darling little child
most unmercifully. To this day I cannot explain my unnatural
depravity, and I wish that I could now—over
fifty years later—meet little Lorchen again to tell her
that this slap was my only way of letting her know how
much I loved her. Alas, she never knew, and as we emigrated
to America soon thereafter, I never had the time
nor the opportunity to overcome my shyness and to place
my love at her feet in proper fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot remember any new passions from then on
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
until my sixteenth year. Lorchen’s picture soon and completely
faded from my memory. I was tremendously
taken up, first with learning English, New York school
life, my musical studies, playing marbles, flying kites,
and building ships to sail on the pond in Central Park.
But when I was fifteen a little Frenchman came to New
York and presented himself to my father with his two
little daughters, Louise and Jeanne, who were both pianist
prodigies. Louise was fifteen and little Jeanne only
twelve. The latter was truly remarkable, and her playing
made quite a stir in New York at the time. But I was
singularly drawn toward the older sister, Louise. Their
mother had died when the children were very young and
Louise had quite taken the mother’s place and watched
over Jeanne with a maternal solicitude and tenderness
truly remarkable in so young a girl. She played exquisitely
herself, and I can still hear the velvety touch of
her fingers in the A Flat Etude of Chopin, but in her
adoration for her younger sister’s more brilliant talent
she completely effaced herself, and it was only with difficulty
that one could get her to play if her sister was present.
They lived in a little French boarding-house and I
used to love to go there in the evening, and while Jeanne
would play for us in most brilliant fashion Louise would
sit at a table in the centre of the room and, under the
mellow light of a centre lamp, would darn stockings or
deftly refashion some dress which Jeanne was to wear at
her next concert. Louise had the gentlest of brown eyes,
and her face and bearing breathed a tranquillity and
sweetness rarely found in the agitating nervous life of
to-day. She was not talkative, but when she spoke her
eyes would smile and crinkle up in very ingratiating
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
I had certainly outgrown the slapping age, but had not
yet developed the courage to declare my adoration. I
seem to have been quite content to sit next to Louise, and
to look into her gentle eyes, or watch her deft fingers as
they pleated and sewed and did all those clever things
which women’s fingers alone know how to do. That
spring, alas, the father and his daughters returned to
France and I have never seen them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But so inconstant is youth that the following year I fell
madly in love with Madame Teresa Carreno, of whom I
have already written in an earlier chapter. I was sixteen
and she was twenty-four, radiantly beautiful, brilliantly
educated, and a remarkable linguist, speaking English,
German, French, Spanish, and Italian with equal fluency.
But for me her eyes spoke a language even more eloquent
than her tongue, and it was small wonder that I was
bowled over completely. On my first concert tour, her
beauty, her exquisite playing, and the languorous half-tropical
charms of the South through which we were
touring was a combination I could not withstand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my schoolboy adoration received a severe shock
when, on the last day of our tour, a handsome and very
robust Italian barytone, by the name of Tagliapietra,
came to meet her and I found that she was madly in love
with him. They were married a short time after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, too, seems to have been unconscious of my adoration.
Thirty-two years later, at a dinner given at the
Hotel Plaza in honor of my twenty-fifth anniversary as a
conductor, she was present and in my speech of thanks
I humorously referred to her as the <span class='it'>grande passion</span> of
my early youth. She afterward told my sister: “I never
knew that Walter had felt like that about me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To proceed with my confessions. The following year
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
I met—but, alas, this chapter is already overcrowded
and I shall have to continue the (to me) so fascinating
recital of my various romances in my next book of memoirs,
which I expect to publish in about twenty years.</p>

<h3>THE ORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>My father had always considered that a study of the
oratorios of Bach and Handel was a highly important
foundation for the young musician, and I had spent
many hours with him in studying their scores and imitating
their form in my own counterpointal work. Bach’s
“St. Matthew’s Passion” and Handel’s “Messiah,”
“Samson,” and “Judas Maccabæus” I knew virtually
by heart. My father also believed the development of
amateur choruses to be a very strong factor in the musical
growth of a people. Under his inspiration the chorus of
the Oratorio Society constantly grew in numbers and
technical proficiency; but it suffered from the great dearth
of men singers, especially tenors. The terribly one-sided
condition of musical development in our country, proceeding
almost exclusively on feminine lines, showed itself
markedly in this branch of the art. Many of the men
singers who in one way or another had been cajoled or
coerced into joining a choral society, had often to be
drilled in their parts like children, though without a
child’s quickness of perception. The result was that the
labor of training was incessant and the mistakes of one
year repeated themselves inevitably the next. In rehearsing
such oratorios as Handel’s “Messiah” or Bach’s
“St. Matthew’s Passion,” for instance, a good routined
conductor could always prophesy beforehand what mistakes
the chorus was going to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my father’s time the sopranos in the Oratorio
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
Society were of overwhelming power and quality; but
this was largely because my mother, when we came to
America, gave up all solo singing in public and devoted
herself enthusiastically to leading the soprano choir. Her
voice was phenomenal in its strength and quality, and
when, as in some fugal chorus of Handel’s, the sopranos
finally enter on the main theme, her triumphant voice
would carry everything along with it. She always sang
by heart, her beautiful, deep-set eyes fixed on the conductor,
and when this conductor happened to be her
own husband or son there was a devotion and a love in
them that I can never forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To maintain a choral society in a huge city like New
York is doubly difficult because of the many temptations
and distractions that beset its members in so large a
metropolis and threaten the regular attendance at rehearsals.
I have always felt, therefore, that the many
splendid performances which the society has given, in its
long existence of forty-nine years, are especially to its
credit. The rehearsals with these amateur singers, however,
demand from the conductor ten times the energy,
patience, and vitality that are necessary with an orchestra
composed of trained professionals. And yet there
is a charm in working with devoted amateurs. My father
loved it, and even during the harassing labors of founding
and maintaining the German opera at the Metropolitan,
he always turned to the regular Thursday-evening chorus
rehearsals of the Oratorio Society as a change and rest.
I confess that I have similarly enjoyed the almost primitive
study necessary with an amateur chorus after a day
spent with my orchestra, and I look back with the deepest
pleasure on the many years during which I conducted
the Oratorio Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
Smaller cities should be able to develop choral societies
far more easily than New York. Toronto, Canada, has
always been an example of what can be accomplished in
that direction. There are four choral societies of high
merit there, among which perhaps the Mendelssohn
Choir, founded by Doctor Vogt, ranks highest. The English
have an inherited love and talent for choral singing,
and in Toronto the weekly rehearsal is the one “dissipation”
of the week, and is eagerly looked forward to by the
singers. I have heard the Mendelssohn Choir repeatedly
on their visits to New York and have been thrilled by the
beauty and volume of their tone and the precision of
their singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have written elsewhere of the great musical festival
which was projected and conducted by my father in
May, 1881. For the great chorus of twelve hundred,
which was its outstanding feature, the four hundred
singers of the Oratorio Society formed the backbone,
and I was intrusted with the drilling of two other sections
of the festival chorus. As I had been the accompanist
and organist for years at all the rehearsals of the
Oratorio Society and had officiated as conductor of the
Newark Harmonic Society for three years after the festival,
I was technically well equipped to take over the
directorship of the Oratorio Society when it was offered
to me after my father’s death in 1885.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I conducted the last concert of that season, Bach’s
“St. Matthew’s Passion,” and found that the affection
and reverence which the chorus cherished for my father
made them help me devotedly in my difficult beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the following season I cast about to find a new
work to mark my entry into this field, and decided that a
concert performance of Wagner’s “Parsifal” would interest
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
the New York public. The sacred character of
the work, the importance and beauty of its choral portions,
and the fact that as yet its music was almost unknown
seemed to me to invite such a performance, even though
Wagner had conceived it for dramatic representation and
with a stage-setting. He had intended the work for performance
only in Bayreuth, but in 1882, when it was first
produced there, he himself had given me an orchestral
score in manuscript of the choral Finale from the first
act to present to my father, so that he might produce
it in concert form in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During a visit to London in the spring of 1886 I called
on the London representative of the publishers of “Parsifal”
and asked whether an orchestral score of the complete
work could be purchased. He told me it could, but
that its purchase would not entitle me to a performance
of the work, and that if I used it for a performance I
would have to pay a fine of fifty pounds. I told him I
was quite ready to pay such a fine as I wanted it for a
concert performance in New York, and promptly bought
an orchestral score and had the orchestral parts copied
from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to my connection with the Metropolitan Opera
House I was able to give the work an exceptional cast.
<span class='it'>Kundry</span> was sung by Marianne Brandt, who had sung it
in Bayreuth at one of the first performances. Max Alvary
was cast for the title rôle, and Emil Fischer for
<span class='it'>Gurnemanz</span>. Alvary became ill shortly before the performance
and his part was taken by another young
tenor of our company, a Mr. Kraemer. The choral portions
were sung by the Oratorio Society with thrilling
effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first performance of “Parsifal” outside of
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
Bayreuth, and it made a sensation but also aroused quite
a controversy in the newspapers as to its fitness for the
concert room. Good and weighty arguments can be
produced on both sides. At a performance in concert
a great deal is lost to many people, especially to those
whose imagination cannot function without the stimulus
of scenery, costumes, and dramatic action; but at that
time this was the only opportunity for American music lovers,
who could not make the long trip to Bayreuth, to
become acquainted with the music. To many listeners
the choral portions, especially those centring in the religious
ceremonies in the Hall of the Holy Grail, were
just as impressive, if not more so, than in a scenic representation.
To-day, and generally speaking, I would
rather hear the music from “Parsifal” with my eyes
closed. My imagination, stimulated by the music, can
paint the scenic and dramatic investiture far more idealistically
than any actual stage representation, but I do
not claim this as a truth for all, but only as my individual
preference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gave two concert performances at the Metropolitan
Opera House (public rehearsal and concert), and over
three thousand people listened with rapt attention at
each rendition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years after, in 1903, when the then director of opera
at the Metropolitan, Heinrich Conried, announced his
intention of giving a stage performance of “Parsifal,” I
received a letter from Madame Cosima Wagner, saying
that she had heard that I possessed the score and orchestral
parts of the work. She begged me not to give them
to Mr. Conried, as the <span class='it'>meister</span> had left absolute directions
in his will that stage representations of this work were to
be reserved for all time for Bayreuth. She had heard
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
that I had given a concert performance and wondered
how I had gotten permission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wrote to her and explained now I had obtained the
score and had sent the “fifty pounds fine” to the publishers,
according to my agreement with them. I then
received another letter from her, as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Damrosch</span>:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Thank you very much for your kind lines and the expression of
your feelings for Parsifal, which, of course, is never to be given out
of Bayreuth; but concerning the production at concert, there has
been made a very limited choice of fragments, which is not to be
extended. The choice, done by the master, is as follows:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>1. Prelude, close of the first act,—nothing of the second.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>2. Verwandlungsmusik—close of the third act.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>3. Amfortasklage</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>4. Charfreitagszauber</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I am astonished that for £50 you got the allowance (permission)
to execute the whole Parsifal in concert and I will ask the publisher
(about it).</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Concerning the performance on the stage, I still hope that the cultivated
part of the public at New York won’t agree to it.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Receive, dear Mr. Damrosch, with my best thanks, my kindest
regards.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>C. Wagner</span></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Bayreuth, 6 Juli, 1903.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Conried, however, obtained his parts elsewhere, and
gave a stage performance that winter. Since then the
copyright on “Parsifal” has run out and it has been produced
all over the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my search for modern works I endeavored also
to keep alive the interest in the old oratorios. I owed
much to them, and their dignity and genuine expression
of religious feeling had been a most important factor in
my early and earliest education. As a boy I sang alto in
the Oratorio Society chorus and at sixteen was promoted
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
to the dignity of accompanist at rehearsals. At this work
I became quite an expert, and if my father stopped at
a certain place to correct the chorus, I would, of course,
know beforehand what he wanted, and would hammer out
the right note for the altos or the tenors—it was usually
the tenors—or would resort, even while they were singing,
to all manner of expedients, such as playing the critical
intervals an octave higher in order to keep up the
pitch or to define them more clearly. As both my mother
and Tante Marie sang in the chorus, there would be the
four of us going home together after a rehearsal, discussing
this or that point which needed more drilling, or a
weakness that needed bolstering up, or we would express
mutual enthusiasm over some chorus particularly well
sung that evening. Naturally the refrain after almost
every rehearsal was: “How can we get ten more first
tenors?” America did not seem to grow them, and as
even basses were not as plentiful as they should have
been, it seemed almost as if the future American composer
should write choruses for women only. If at the voice
trial of new applicants, which usually took place before
or after rehearsal, that <span class='it'>rara avis</span>, a tenor, was found, we
glowed with delight and speculated as to whether he
would really turn up at the next rehearsal and become a
regular member. It cannot be claimed that tenors are
to be found in profusion even to-day, but there has been
an immense development in the quality of choral singers.
Their voices are better trained, they read better at
sight, and the general increase of interest in music manifests
itself very strongly in this direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1892 I gave a Handel festival in honor of the one-hundred-and-fiftieth
anniversary of the first performance
of Handel’s “Messiah” in Dublin under his own direction,
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
in 1742, followed by the one which King George II and
his court attended, and when the crowd was so great that
the management requested the gentlemen not to wear their
swords nor the ladies their hoop-skirts, in order to enable
as many as possible to hear the work of “Mr. Handel.”
At this performance, when the Hallelujah chorus began,
with its mighty climax, “King of Kings, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!” King George, overcome with emotion, arose
and remained standing until the end. Naturally the
entire audience rose in imitation of their royal master,
and Great Britain has continued this custom ever since.
As this was a fitting homage both to the Almighty and
to the composer who in this chorus so marvellously
voiced man’s adoration for him, my father introduced
the custom at his own first performance of the “Messiah,”
in 1874, and the Oratorio Society audiences have
followed it to this day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An interesting account of the kind of orchestra Handel
may have employed is given in a description of a memorial
service of the “Messiah,” sung in Westminster Abbey
shortly after his death. I decided to reproduce such an
orchestra as far as possible at our festival performance.
The main characteristics consisted in the doubling up of
the string parts in the choruses with oboes and bassoons
and in duplicating the trumpets and kettledrums in the
choral climaxes. The effect of this was most remarkable.
I had placed an additional oboe with every three violins
and an additional bassoon for every three violoncellos,
with a few contrabassoons and contrabass clarinets to
strengthen the double-basses and to take the part of the
serpent—an instrument which has become obsolete.
The doubling up of trumpets and kettledrums in the
climaxes did not make them sound louder, but more full.
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
For the first time in my experience the sound of the orchestra
was not completely buried in the avalanche of
tone from a large chorus of three hundred and fifty
voices. The orchestral accompaniments supported and
supplemented the chorus in a way that perhaps only a
very large and mellow church organ might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Handel’s time he himself usually sat at the organ
and filled in with masterly improvisations many of the
harmonies for which in his score he had written only the
bass, with figures indicating the harmonies which the
organist should improvise. Since then various musicians
have endeavored to supply these harmonies in permanent
fashion by writing them for other instruments in the orchestra,
principally for clarinets and bassoons. As most
concert-halls are but poorly supplied with organs, these
arrangements offered a kind of substitute, and the one
most in use was that of Robert Franz. He was a German
composer of very lovely songs, and a great admirer of
Handel, but, curiously enough, his arrangements were
very bad and not in keeping with the Handelian spirit.
Mozart also had written accompaniments to supply the
missing harmonies for a performance of the “Messiah”
in Vienna at a hall in which there was no church organ.
His additions, especially in the air “The people that
walked in darkness,” are of such transcendent beauty
that when I proceeded in my work of restoring the Handelian
orchestra to its original form my courage failed
me completely as I came to this air. It was as if one
master had found a painting by another and had encircled
it in a frame of such beauty as to enhance the
value of the original picture. I could not bear to disturb
it, but the clarinets and bassoons of Robert Franz
were thrown out by me with great gusto.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
Another novel and interesting feature of our festival
was a scenic stage performance of a charming pastoral of
Handel’s “Acis and Galatea.” This proved to have
dramatic qualities which in their appeal seemed way
beyond that of the many Italian operas which Handel
has written. The cast was excellent. The part of <span class='it'>Galatea</span>
was sung by Madame de Vere, a charming coloratura
singer; the shepherd <span class='it'>Acis</span> by William Rieger, one of our
best young concert tenors; and <span class='it'>Polyphemus</span>, the giant,
by that master artist, Emil Fischer. The scene represented
a landscape of classic beauty, and all the participants
were clad in very charming Greek shepherd
costumes. The scene in which <span class='it'>Polyphemus</span>, coming upon
the shepherd lovers, lifts a huge rock and in jealous rage
kills Acis, was done with such dramatic intensity as to
thrill our audiences. The performance was a real event,
as this work had perhaps not been given in its dramatic
form since the time of Handel; but, curiously enough, it
roused but little interest, for, whereas all the other performances
of the festival were crowded to the doors, we
had but half an audience at our two performances of the
pastoral. It came about twenty years too early, and I
think that to-day, especially if given under the auspices
of the Metropolitan Opera, it would arouse wide-spread
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This spring (1922) I was in Munich and the town was
in great excitement over the approaching performance of
Handel’s “Acis and Galatea” in dramatic form. Their
conductor, Bruno Walter, said to me: “We are very
proud of this stage performance, as it is the first since
Handel’s time.” He was amazed and, as he told me, much
chagrined when I informed him that I had given it in
New York nearly thirty years ago. He gave it a beautiful
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
performance. I had costumed my singers in classic
Greek, but the Munich stage director had given the work
an additional and rather piquant flavor by dressing the
singers and dancers as in Handel’s time, when all performers,
in no matter what age their plays were supposed to
take place, wore the costumes and huge periwigs of their
own period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1898 we were much excited by the
dramatic accounts of Admiral Dewey’s victory in Manila
Bay, and it seemed to me fitting to celebrate it by composing
a “Te Deum” for soloists, chorus, and orchestra.
In order to give my “Manila Te Deum” an appropriate
character, I used several of the bugle-calls of the American
army and navy as a <span class='it'>cantus firmus</span>, around which I wove
the fugal developments of the voices of the chorus. In
the last chorus, “O Lord, in thee have I trusted; let
me never be confounded,” I used the “Star-Spangled
Banner” in similar fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work received its first performance at a concert
of the Oratorio Society, December 3, 1898, and marked
the introduction of my brother as regular conductor of
the society. The following spring I was invited to conduct
it at a Dewey celebration in Chicago, and on February
6, 1900, I directed it again at a special performance
given in Carnegie Hall, the proceeds of which were to be
used toward the building of an arch in honor of Admiral
Dewey. This arch, however, was never built, and the
several thousand dollars which resulted from our concert
were finally donated by the Dewey Arch Committee to a
philanthropic purpose. Our two guests of honor at this
performance were Admiral Dewey, in a box on one side
of the hall, and Theodore Roosevelt, at that time Governor
of New York, in a box on the other side. Roosevelt was
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
to make an appropriate address, and as the victor of
Manila Bay was present and the entire occasion was one
of jubilant admiration for our navy, we expected one
of Roosevelt’s most flaming patriotic addresses on the
glories of the American navy. But, alas, that evening
his mind was completely occupied with things nearer
home, and after a few very courteous remarks about my
music, he launched forth into a terrific speech on the
Street Cleaning Department of New York and the
“duty of every citizen to vote at the primaries”!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1892 I gave the first performance in America of
Saint-Saëns’s opera of “Samson and Delilah.” This
work is admirably adapted for concert performance, and
many portions of it are far more effective in this form than
on the stage. The music is lovely and of great melodic
simplicity, and many of the choruses are written in oratorio
form. At stage performances the dramatic climax
of the second act, in which <span class='it'>Delilah</span> appears jubilantly at
the door of her palace, shaking <span class='it'>Samson’s</span> red wig triumphantly
at the admiring high priest and soldiers, is really
an anticlimax, and excites our risibilities much more
than our sorrow that the God-given strength of the
mighty soldier has left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From my father I have inherited a deep admiration for
Hector Berlioz and have conducted many performances
of his greater works—the “Damnation of Faust,” the
“Requiem Mass,” “Romeo and Juliet,” and the first
rendition in America of his “Te Deum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another novelty which I produced with the Oratorio
Society in 1889 was the “Missa Solemnis” of Edward
Grell. This work created a sensation. Its composer
was virtually unknown except locally in Berlin, where he
had been a teacher of counterpoint and composition in the
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
first half of the nineteenth century. He had lived himself
so completely into the style of the Italian masters of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that modern
harmonies simply did not exist for him, and his “Missa
Solemnis” is conceived absolutely in the manner of the
early masters of ecclesiastical music. It is written for
four choruses of four parts each and four solo quartets.
There is absolutely no accompaniment, and the purity of
these sixteen-part harmonies without any admixture of
instruments produces truly celestial effects. The four
choruses which are generally used antiphonally with the
solo quartets, produce thrilling climaxes, and the <span class='it'>Benedictus</span>
especially gives an impression of ecstatic beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have written elsewhere, of my first performance of
the “Christus,” by Liszt. I also produced “St. Christopher,”
by Horatio Parker, distinguished American musician
and composer. This work, however, did not prove
as effective as his “Hora Novissima.” It seemed to fall
between two stools, as it was neither an opera nor an
oratorio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave, of course, many renditions of the oratorios of
Handel, Haydn, and Mendelssohn, and inaugurated the
custom of an annual performance of Bach’s “St. Matthew’s
Passion” during Holy Week. I am happy to
say that I succeeded in “popularizing” this mighty work,
so that now it draws a huge and devout audience whenever
it is given. But, generally speaking, the interest in
the older oratorios is waning, not only in New York but
all over the country. The ears of our audiences have lost
pleasure in the simpler harmonies of Handel and Haydn,
and, accustomed to the richer orchestration of to-day,
find the accompaniments of the Handelian orchestra thin
and archaic. Something of the simple and naïve religious
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
faith that inspired the old oratorios has also gone,
and the composer has not yet been found who can voice
the faith and aspirations of to-day. It is a pity that the
old oratorio form should therefore be neglected. I think,
however, that it is not dead but only sleeps, and will
awaken again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1898 I retired as conductor of the Oratorio Society,
owing to the pressure of my operatic and orchestral work,
and my brother Frank was elected as my successor. He
is two years older than I and has always shared my love
and enthusiasm for music in an equal degree. He studied
the piano as a boy, but had always insisted that his talent
was not great enough to warrant making music his profession;
and therefore, at the age of seventeen, he with
great courage determined to go out West and begin a
business career. Arrived in Denver, Colorado, with one
hundred dollars in his pocket, he proceeded, in the manner
of our American young men who have no intention of becoming
a burden on their parents, to earn his own living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began at the very bottom and slowly worked his
way upward, but suffered intensely during his first years
in Denver from the almost total lack of music there. He
had drunk of it in such generous quantities in New York
that it had become a larger part of his very life than he
had realized; and in order to satisfy his need he founded
a choral society with which he gave some of the old
oratorios, and with characteristic audacity he supplemented
this with an orchestra composed of a handful of
professionals then playing at the Denver theatres and a
few amateurs. The citizens of Denver, realizing that he
was a real musician in spite of his modest estimate of
himself, urged him to give up business and turn altogether
to music.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
At the time of my father’s death Frank had become
virtually the moving force in all the higher musical enterprises
of Denver. It seemed to me that the time had
come to urge him to return to New York and together
with me continue the work my father had begun. He
was promptly engaged as chorus master at the Metropolitan
Opera House, and also became more and more
active in pedagogic work, for which he had a special enthusiasm
which has never waned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His activities extended in many directions. He founded
the Young People’s Concerts at Carnegie Hall, and became
supervisor of music in the public schools of New
York, completely reforming the teaching of music. The
good effects of this are felt to this day. He also founded
the People’s Choral Union, in which working men and
women were taught singing and the rudiments of music
and then promoted into a chorus of twelve hundred voices
which studied and performed the old oratorios of Handel
and Haydn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He officiated as conductor of the Oratorio Society from
1898 until 1912, and during this period conducted first
performances in New York of Edward Elgar’s “The
Dream of Gerontius” and “The Apostles,” Anton
Dvořák’s “Stabat Mater,” Gabriel Pierné’s “Children’s
Crusade,” Johannes Brahms’s “Song of Fate,” and
Wolf-Ferrari’s “La Vita Nuova.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His interest in the pedagogy of music culminated in the
founding of a music-school—the Institute of Musical Art—which
was liberally endowed by James Loeb and
others, and which has developed into one of the few
great music-schools of this country and Europe. This
school soon began to assume such proportions as to demand
all of his time and vitality. He therefore retired
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
from other public work, with the exception of the conductorship
of the Society of Musical Art, a unique chorus
of sixty-five professional singers, giving only two concerts
during the season, representing the highest that
can be attained in choral singing. For its programmes he
drew upon the rich and partly unknown treasures of the
<span class='it'>a capella</span> choruses of such masters as Palestrina, Orlando
di Lasso, Cornelius, and Brahms; and as this chorus was
composed of the very elect of New York’s church and
concert singers he obtained results ravishing in their
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we were boys together we quarrelled dreadfully
and outrageously. Frank would try to assert his two
years’ seniority over me and I would resent this with
both hands and feet. I remember my mother resolutely
separating us and giving me a little room to myself, as
that seemed the only way to achieve peace between us.
But I am happy to say that since 1885, when Frank returned
to New York, we have lived and worked together
in absolute harmony and mutual helpfulness. In fact,
the unity between us has been so complete that we are
now inclined by contrast to consider each other as having
been exceptionally devilish and nasty during those early
boyhood years. I know, of course, that the blame was
entirely his, as he was so overbearing and presuming because
of the accident of his earlier birth, while he is
equally convinced that I was altogether too cheeky for
my age and it was absolutely necessary for my own good
and future welfare to put me where I belonged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1919 I was again asked to assume the direction of
the Oratorio Society. Their affairs had not prospered
after my brother had relinquished the conductorship.
A huge debt threatened to engulf them, and, while I was
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
overwhelmed with work in connection with the New York
Symphony Orchestra, with which I gave over a hundred
concerts every winter, I could not resist their appeal and
promised to stay by them until they could find a permanent
conductor to their liking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am glad to say that the man was found in Albert
Stoessel. He had been a bandmaster in the A. E. F. during
the war, had been chosen as teacher of conducting at
the bandmaster’s school in Chaumont, which I had
founded for General Pershing, and had become my
assistant conductor at the rehearsals of the Oratorio
Society. The chorus were delighted with him, and he was
elected as regular conductor of the society in 1920. He
has already conducted two highly successful seasons, and
I think that our beloved old society will have many years
of life and success under his direction.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span><h1>XIV</h1></div>

<h3>THE NEW YORK SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When my father died there were only three symphony
orchestras in America, the New York Symphony, the
New York Philharmonic (Thomas formed his travelling
orchestra from this), and the Boston Symphony. The
last of these was supported by Major Higginson, and
was the only one whose members received weekly salaries
for a season of thirty weeks, met every morning for
rehearsal, and devoted themselves exclusively to the
playing of symphonic music. It was the first so-called
“permanent orchestra” founded in America. The New
York orchestras at that time played only a very small
number of symphony concerts, for each of which they had
about three rehearsals. Their members added to their
earnings by playing in odd concerts, opera, theatre, in
fact, in almost anything that they could find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day the New York Symphony is splendidly maintained
as a permanent orchestra through the generosity
of its president, Mr. Flagler. The Philharmonic is similarly
supported by liberal contributions from various
sources, and other orchestras in Philadelphia, Chicago,
Detroit, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles use from a hundred thousand dollars a
year upward, donated by their respective citizens, over
and above the receipts from the sale of tickets, in order
to maintain themselves as permanent symphonic organizations.
Without such subsidies these orchestras
could not exist, as, even though the concerts are crowded,
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
the expenditures are much greater than any possible receipts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wonder how many of the conductors of these orchestras,
who all receive generous salaries and have no personal
financial risk in the enterprise, realize what up-hill
pioneer work we had to do in the early days to keep our
orchestras alive and to lay the musical foundations on
which they are now so solidly built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After my father’s death I was elected, at the age of
twenty-three, conductor of the New York Symphony
Society. We used to give six concerts and six public rehearsals
during the winter, and for the seven years following
my election this orchestra was also employed for the
German opera at the Metropolitan. But when German
opera was supplanted by Italian under Abbey, Schoeffel,
and Grau, I was hard put to it to find sufficient work for
my men to keep them together. The little subsidy which
was at that time contributed by the directors of the
Symphony Society was only large enough to give the six
regular concerts of the winter season. I had learned the
difficult art of accompanying soloists sympathetically with
the orchestra, and the foreign artists who came to America,
such as Sarasate, Ysaye, d’Albert, Joseffy, Paderewski,
Kubelik, and many others, always chose my orchestra
to accompany them. But these concerts were comparatively
few, and I had to look for other ways of giving my
men enough work to make it worth their while to stay
with me instead of accepting travelling engagements
with little opera companies, etc. Gradually I developed
Sunday-afternoon symphony concerts, a complete innovation,
as up to that time the only music given on Sundays
was in the evening and of the more popular and
trivial character. I argued that Sunday was the one day
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
in the week when men were not immersed in business
cares, and that on that day they and their families would
be more susceptible to the appreciation of a higher and
more serious class of music. I therefore boldly inaugurated
a series of symphonic concerts for every Sunday
afternoon during the winter; and my faith was justified,
as not only were these concerts attended by huge audiences,
but the percentage of men was greater than had
ever been seen at symphony concerts before. For several
years I enjoyed a monopoly of my idea, but then
other orchestras and soloists perceived its value, and to-day
I have to share Sunday afternoons with two or
three other organizations who also give high-class concerts,
all of which are generally well attended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also gradually developed long spring tours with fifty
men, which in those days was considered a travelling
orchestra of good size. On these tours I penetrated the
South, the Middle West, and, later on, the Far West of
California and Oregon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the communities that we visited had never
heard a symphony orchestra before, and for them we did
real pioneer work, as I maintained a high standard of
music on my programmes. The classics were, of course,
the foundation; but Wagner very soon became a great
drawing power, and Wagner programmes were often the
most asked for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general plan of my tours was to have the advance
agent organize three-day festivals with a local chorus
which would take part in some oratorio or concert excerpts
from the operas of Wagner, Verdi, etc. I would
also carry a quartet of solo singers, sometimes supplemented
by a “star,” for the average American public
dearly loves a “name.” Many of these stars make their
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
greatest money long after their vocal powers have diminished,
and they are compelled to make up this lack
by adventitious means such as extraordinary costumes,
perhaps more decolleté than local custom would sanction,
but which are always considered as quite the right thing
for so exotic a personage as the “prima donna.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these three-day festivals we would generally
give five concerts, and, as we often booked two festivals
in one week, the ten concerts and necessary rehearsals
often proved a great strain on my vitality. But it had to
be done, as the local festival committees were compelled
to crowd in as many concerts as possible to make their
expenses. It has always been fascinating to me to do
pioneer work, either by organizing something new, introducing
a new composer, or penetrating into regions where
symphonic music was not yet known. The gratitude of
the people was often very touching, and if my profits at
the end of an arduous tour were sometimes not so large
as they should have been, I had at least kept my orchestra
together for eight, ten, or even twelve weeks, and had
enlarged the radius of musical activity by many hundreds—sometimes
thousands—of miles. I marvel now
at the courage with which I would start on a tour in
which perhaps only half my concerts were guaranteed,
and these guarantees, alas, not always paid up in full.
But for years I was almost the only one travelling through
the country with an orchestra, and as railroad fares were
just half of what they are to-day I was generally able to
end my tour with some profit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also began to tackle the question of how to utilize my
orchestra during the summer months, and had the good
luck to solve that problem for many years very effectively.
As early as 1885 and 1886 I was invited by the
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
Southern Exposition of Louisville, Kentucky, to come
there with my orchestra and play the entire summer,
giving two concerts a day. I shall always look back on
those two summers with delight and gratitude. I was
very young and it was my first experience of a prolonged
stay in a Southern city. Louisville at that time was a
small community, but with an old civilization which
manifested itself in a circle of charming people of established
culture and social relations. They opened their
doors and their hearts to my brother and me. The
Pendennis Club, in its old-fashioned courtesy and hospitality,
was like a page out of Thackeray or Dickens.
Most of the people had never heard symphonic music,
and as we played twice a day for about three months, I
gave them almost the entire orchestral repertoire, ranging
from the good popular music of Johann Strauss
through the symphonies of Mozart, Beethoven, and the
modern composers, to Wagner, who immediately became
their “favorite composer.” The members of my orchestra
were also received with great cordiality, and several
very tender and romantic love-affairs were the result.
I too would gladly have fallen a victim to the charms of
these Southern beauties, but, alas, I was such a hard-worked
young man with my two concerts a day and rehearsals
that I could not indulge myself much in romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, during a terrific thunder-storm, the lightning
crashed into the machinery furnishing the electric
light of the music-hall, and plunged it in darkness. It
was crowded with thousands of listeners and for a few
minutes there was an awe-struck silence, broken only by
the great crashes of thunder. Gradually hysterical cries
from the women were heard here and there and a rush
for the doors began. The darkness was intense, but I
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
knew the orchestra could play the march from “Le
Prophète” by heart, so I shouted to them to begin this
number. I can still hear old Karl Deis, who had been
trombone player under my father, beginning all alone
with the opening theme, followed immediately by the
rest of the orchestra. I was conducting like mad, although,
owing to the darkness, not one of the players
could see me, except when the flashes of lightning momentarily
illuminated the hall; but the music immediately
calmed the audience, who sat down and at the conclusion
of the march applauded vociferously. We then started
the “Beautiful Blue Danube,” and in the second bar the
electric lights of the hall blazed up again. The following
evening the chief of the fire department and other city
officials appeared, and with several bottles of champagne
toasted the orchestra and its conductor for their “great
life-saving act” of the evening before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sundays there were no concerts, and they became
blessed days of peace and rest. I usually spent them at
the country place of a friend—a roomy, hospitable,
Southern mansion, delicious noon dinner, and afterward
a lazy, happy time on the lawn, watching the horses,
beautiful, full-blooded, Kentucky bred, gambolling about
without saddle or bridle, like young puppies, according
to the old-established Sunday custom of the place. To
the Kentuckian the love for his horses and pride in their
qualities is part of the romance of his life; at least it
was in those days, long before the automobile had made
its appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The many concerts at the Louisville Exposition, coming
at the beginning of my career as an orchestral conductor,
gave me enormous routine and acquaintance
with the entire orchestral repertoire.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
I found the South exceedingly receptive. New Orleans
had, of course, been a supporter of French opera
for years—its opera-house was one of the most charming
I had ever seen—but I also established new centres for
music, one of which developed very successfully in the
little town of Spartanburg, South Carolina. The impulse
here came from the Converse College for Women,
which has a high reputation in the South. The young
ladies of this institution formed the nucleus of a large and
well-trained chorus of two hundred and fifty voices. I
went there with my orchestra every spring for over ten
years. We succeeded in building up a great love and appreciation
for music there and in other near-by places,
as it was the custom for the alumnæ of the college to return
to Spartanburg for Music Festival week and then
to carry back and spread their musical enthusiasm in
their home towns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually I penetrated farther and farther West. In
1904 I made a tour as far as Oklahoma City with the orchestra
and quite a large group of solo singers, with whom
I gave excerpts from Wagner’s “Parsifal,” connecting
the various numbers with a few explanatory remarks.
The tour was highly successful, as the public had read
much about the first performances of “Parsifal” at
Bayreuth and New York, and were keen to hear the
music. I recall an amusing incident in Oklahoma City.
Our concert had been scheduled as part of a course of
entertainments under a local manager. The theatre was
crowded and I had just finished the Prelude to “Parsifal”
and was ready to begin the excerpts from the first
act, when suddenly the manager popped up on the
stage and addressed the audience somewhat as follows:
“Ladies and gentlemen: I am proud to see so many of
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
you here to-night and take this opportunity of announcing
to you that I have already made arrangements for
next season for a course which will be in every respect
finer than the one I am giving you this year! I also
would like to announce that Stewart’s Oyster Saloon will
be open after the concert for lunch.” (Sic.) This was,
however, our only interruption, and the rest of the music
was listened to with evident interest and enthusiastic
approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the concert was over, as I left by the stage door
to return to my hotel, I was met by the crowd of people
descending from the top gallery. A young man who
had been lounging against the stage entrance went up
to one of the men who was coming out of the theatre
and said: “Well, how was it, Jim?” and Jim answered:
“This show ain’t worth thirty cents.” The woes of <span class='it'>Amfortas</span>
and the lilting measures of the <span class='it'>Flower Maidens</span> had
evidently not appealed to this young Oklahoman!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In contrast to this experience I should like to relate
what happened another time when we were giving a
symphony concert, perhaps the first ever heard there, at
Fargo, North Dakota. Efrem Zimbalist, delightful man
and artist, was our soloist on this tour, and after the concert,
when we met for supper, he related with shouts of
laughter that while I was playing the “Lenore” Symphony,
by Raff, he was sitting behind the scenes of the “opera-house”—every
Western city has a “grand opera-house”—listening
to the music, when a cowboy, young, handsome,
in flannel shirt, high boots, slouch hat, etc., came on the
stage and sat down amicably next to him. The cowboy
was perhaps a little “mellow,” as this was before the days
of national prohibition, but he evidently had a musical
ear, although he had never before in his life heard a symphony
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
orchestra. Every time that the music developed
into a kind of joyous climax, he would grab Zimbalist’s
knee in convulsive delight and shout: “God damn it,
but I like that music!” Then he would sit in rapt silence
until the next outburst, when he would again grab Zimbalist
and shout: “They can go to hell, but they know
how to play!” We all envied this man, because, no matter
how much we may appreciate music, we have heard
so much that we can never again experience the thrill of
hearing a symphony orchestra for the first time in our
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story, of course, went the rounds of the orchestra,
and for weeks afterward, if we were seated in the dining-car
of our train, the voice of one of the musicians might
be heard above the roar of the cars and the din of the
clattering knives and forks shouting in joyous accents:
“God damn it, but I like this omelet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of dining-cars, on one of our Western tours
during the first years of the war we had heard much about
the sad conditions of the Belgians, whose territory had
been so ruthlessly overrun by the German armies. Our
entire orchestra had just responded unanimously and
generously in contributing toward the Belgian Relief
Fund, and in the dining-car at the table opposite mine
were seated our second flute player, a Belgian, together
with his son, who was one of our talented violoncellists.
Their plates were heaped with turkey, cranberry sauce,
and potatoes, and there was an apple-pie in the offing.
I said: “I thought the Belgians were starving!” “Oh,”
said Barrère, the ever-ready and ever-witty, “ils mangent
pour les autres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much we have owed on these tours to George
Barrère! He has always been for me a model member of
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
an orchestra. He is a great artist—perhaps the greatest
on the flute that I have ever heard—but no rehearsal is
too long for him, and the inevitable contretemps of travel
are accepted by him with imperturbable good nature. I
have described elsewhere with what difficulty I was
enabled to import him from France seventeen years ago,
owing to the opposition made by the New York Musical
Union, but he has more than justified his claims to
American citizenship since then, not only by his artistic
work, but by the group of American pupils whom he has
gathered around him, who are devoted to him and have
received and made their own much of his artistry. He
is a delightful mixture of Gallic wit and American humor.
He was asked once: “If you were not a musician, Monsieur
Barrère, what would you like to be?” and he
promptly answered: “An orchestral conductor!” A
wicked remark, but as he has since then become the conductor
of Barrère’s Little Symphony Orchestra I can give
him tit for tat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the war broke out I found that as we had thirteen
nationalities in the orchestra, including all the nations
at war, relations might often become strained, especially
on our long tours when the men are forced, in
the sleeping-cars and at the concerts, into constant and
close companionship. I therefore gave them a little talk
in which I explained that as they were gaining their
living in this country and as they were artists for
otherwise they would not be in the New York Symphony—their
first duties were toward their art, toward me, and
toward their families whom they were supporting in
honorable fashion, and that therefore for the time being
it was for the good of all to sink their political differences
and their various attitudes toward the war, and
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
to live in harmony with each other. This talk had good
results, as during the entire four years of war I cannot
recall any serious difference or quarrel between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, of course, serious discussions and sometimes
good-natured raillery. At that time Rudolf Rissland
was the leader of my second violins and had charge
of the orchestra during the long tours. He has been with
me a great many years and I value him highly as a man
of character and loyalty. He is of German birth, and,
although he had become a patriotic American, he
always wore his blond moustache combed upward in
German fashion. We had been informed before our
Canadian tour that no players of German birth would be
admitted into Canada, but, thanks to the British ambassador,
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, an old friend of my wife’s
family, we received a special permission for the few
German-born who had not yet received their second
citizen papers, to enter Canada, as I gladly made myself
responsible for them. We were the only orchestra that
gave concerts in Toronto and Montreal during the war.
On this particular trip, after our train had left Toronto,
the orchestra began to twit Rissland unmercifully, accusing
him of having in most cowardly fashion combed his
moustache downward before coming on the stage for
the concert. At first he denied this absolutely, but
finally confessed that he had combed down the side turned
toward the audience, but had kept the other side defiantly
turned upward!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of venting their feelings against a nation by
maltreating the music of its composers at rehearsals or
concerts never entered the minds of our players. Our
Frenchmen would play a symphony of Beethoven or an
excerpt from a Wagner music-drama with the same care
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
and enthusiasm as a work by one of their own composers.
The same was true vice versa of our German-born members.
To the good musician art is international, although
each nation has its own standards and traditions of interpretation,
and it is interesting to note how sharply opposed
these sometimes are. There is often a curious
racial antagonism between the French and Italian musicians.
The Frenchman will insist that the phrasing of
the Italian is sloppy and hypersentimental, while the
Italian will retort that the Frenchman’s is academic and
rigid. Every nation has its excellent qualities, and the
finest orchestra in the world is one composed of the best
of the different nationalities moulded into one harmonious
whole by a master conductor without racial musical
prejudice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our visits to California were perhaps enjoyed the most
of all. These began long before the earthquake and fire
had destroyed the old San Francisco, and when the city
had all the romance of earlier days and Chinatown was
still an exotic and fascinating region of mystery. The
society of San Francisco was different from that of any
other city in the United States. It was composed largely
of restless pioneers from the East and from other countries
who, having “worked their way” across the continent,
had finally stopped and settled in San Francisco
because the Pacific Ocean prevented them from going
still farther, and also because in California nature opened
both arms wide in welcome, and gave of her bounty so freely
that life and the necessity of supporting it became an easy
matter. Many of the well-to-do sent their sons and
daughters, not to New York and Boston, but to Paris
and London, for their education. Society was international
in that it comprised Americans, Germans, French,
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
and Italians. They all loved music instinctively, and gave
it enthusiastic acclaim, much as in a city of Italy or the
Midi of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few trained symphony orchestras had penetrated so
far West, and my orchestra was a revelation to many of
our hearers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For me there were also pleasant visits to San Mateo
and other beautiful places near by, where one could see a
good game of polo or tennis and have one’s gastronomic
needs delightfully ministered to by Chinese cooks and
Japanese butlers. In those days Los Angeles was but a
small city and no one then dreamed of the unique and
lightning-like development which has made it in a few
years one of the most important cities in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In continuing our tour farther north we came under
the management of two very remarkable women, under
the firm name of “Steers and Coman,” who virtually
control the musical field from Oregon and Washington
as far east as Denver. Miss Lois Steers and Miss Wynne
Coman live in Portland, Oregon. By dint of their organizing
genius and enthusiasm for music, and an absolute
integrity in all business dealings, they have not only won
the highest respect and confidence of the communities
to which they minister but have built up a very effective
organization. Under their auspices every great
artist who has ever visited this country has appeared
not only in the larger cities of the States which they
control, but in many of the smaller university towns and
farming communities in which the Misses Steers and
Coman have been able to develop an interest in music.
They are not only business women of superior qualities,
but ladies of such fine sympathies and breeding that I
have always felt particularly honored by their friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
On our tours, Miss Steers usually attended to the local
needs of the cities we visited—the music committees, the
hall managers, and the newspapers—while Miss Coman
travelled with us as general railroad manager, baggage
despatcher, and “committee of one,” to smooth out all
difficulties, adjust any disputes and, in general, to “oil the
wheels.” As soon as we came into their territory everything
moved like clockwork. I remember one agonizing
day, however, when we had to make Salt Lake City from
the West and terrible floods had disarranged all railroad
schedules. The final jolt came when, at some station on
the way, John Drew’s two cars containing his dramatic
company and scenery were added to our already over-heavy
train because the floods had compelled him also
to change his route. All hope of reaching Salt Lake City
in time for our concert seemed gone. Miss Coman hopped
onto the engine and sat down next to the engineer and
stoker. I did not know whether she used a woman’s
wiles or brute force or a combination of both, but we
arrived in Salt Lake City at nine <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span> on a lovely summer
evening. An audience of two thousand had been
notified that we would be late and were calmly promenading
up and down in front of the theatre. Trucks were in
waiting at the station to rush our baggage to the auditorium,
our men had put on their evening dress in the
baggage-car, and I began the opening overture with all
the instruments properly tuned at ten minutes before
ten. Symphony concerts were so few and far between
in Salt Lake City that the audience did not mind this
long wait one little bit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course all these difficulties could not have been so
happily solved had I not always had devoted and efficient
heads of the different departments of our organization.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
George Engles is the most careful of business managers;
Rissland, the orchestra manager, has always been tireless
in his efforts to keep the men in good discipline and
spirits and to look after their welfare; and Hans Goettich,
who has been my baggage-master and librarian for over
twenty-five years, is a perfect marvel. I remember
seeing him flag an entire train because he had suddenly
noticed that our baggage-car, containing all our music
and musical instruments, had been hooked on to it by
mistake. As this train was going to New Orleans, while
we were headed for Chicago, we would have had to stop
giving concerts for several days until that baggage-car
had been traced and sent back to us! On Goettich devolves
the entire responsibility for the library, which is
packed in dozens of boxes and kept according to a system
of his own. On these long tours our programmes are
changed more or less every day, partly to avoid the
monotony of repetition for us and partly because each
community has its own needs according to its stage of
musical development, which I try to gauge very thoroughly
when making up my programmes. This means
incessant work for the librarian and mistakes might easily
occur, but during all these years I cannot recall a single
concert when, through fault of Goettich’s, an orchestral
part has been lost or misplaced. This is a remarkable
record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember giving a symphony concert in William J.
Bryan’s town of Lincoln, Nebraska. I found a typical
Middle Western community, living in nice houses with
green lawns, with neatly bricked streets and concrete
sidewalks, and roomy large-windowed schools. The
theatre in which we played was thoroughly modern, clean,
and well lighted, and the audience well dressed and appreciative.
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
One of my double-bass players told me that
he had played there thirty years before with Theodore
Thomas. In those days Lincoln was but a frontier town
and the theatre and the public who had come to hear the
Thomas Orchestra were of a more or less primitive character.
My double-bass player told me that with a colleague,
whose head was devoid of hair, he had stood directly
below a proscenium box in which a group of cowboys
were seated. While the orchestra was playing
Beethoven’s “Fifth Symphony,” one of these cowboys,
who was chewing tobacco violently, amused himself by
spitting frequently and always aiming for the bald head
of the bass player, who had to keep one agitated eye on
the conductor and the other on this horribly resourceful
listener, in order to avoid his only too-well-directed
shots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our orchestra always enjoyed the long spring tours,
although now and then uncomfortable happenings would
mar their pleasure. Nothing makes a musician so ill-natured
as to be deprived of a good square meal, and
sometimes our dining-car would not connect properly or
we would be so delayed as to arrive in a town only just
in time to rush to the theatre and give our concert.
Then I would have to exert all my powers as an orator to
induce them to go directly to the theatre instead of
“loitering by the wayside,” and I would quickly order
large quantities of ham and swiss-cheese sandwiches to
be distributed behind the scenes just before the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present our players while on tour receive so much
per day above their salaries for meals and beds, but in
the early days I used to pay their hotel expenses, my
manager engaging rooms and arranging the rates “on the
American plan” before we arrived in the city in which we
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
were to play. This system, however, never worked well
because there was always intense jealousy among the
musicians as to the quality or conveniences of their
respective rooms; and if the first oboe found that his
room did not front on as agreeable a locality as that of
the first horn, he would perhaps sulk and consider that
he had been unfairly treated. The newer arrangement
proved much better, as it enabled some to save from the
money allowed them and permitted others to “splurge”
by spending more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember that once in those early days we had to
fill in a date in a small New York State town on our way
to Canada. The principal hotel had room for only about
twenty, and the other members of the orchestra were
quartered in four other hotels. Naturally the unfortunate
five who were put into the last of these had a terrible
story to tell of their sufferings when we met the following
morning at the station. To be sure, the manager of the
hotel had charged only a dollar for each person, and this
included his supper, bed, and breakfast, but their rooms
had been dismal and the beds hard. The climax was
reached in the morning, when, as a frowsy waitress began
to serve them their breakfast in the fly-specked
dining-room on a table covered with the inevitable dirty
red and white checked cloth, the manager, putting his
head in at the door, shouted: “Lizzie, no eggs for the
band!” This phrase became a catchword in the orchestra,
and whenever my manager or I refused anything to
our men, the cry immediately resounded: “Of course, no
eggs for the band!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Orchestra players through experience become remarkably
routined travellers. They know the good hotels and
restaurants in every city of the Union, and during the
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
long railroad jumps, especially west of the Mississippi,
where distances between important cities become greater
and greater, they know how to amuse themselves, each
one according to his fashion. There are, of course, a few
groups who play poker violently from morning till night.
Others are equally constant to pinochle or bridge, while a
few are perfect sharks at chess. The Frenchmen, as well
as the Russian Jews, are great readers of serious literature,
and books on history, philosophy, and music are in
great demand among them. Whenever the train stops,
even for a few minutes, a dozen jump off to play ball.
As a rule, during the day we have two cars, one of which
is given up to the smokers, where indeed the air becomes
so thick that one could cut it with a knife. At night
three or four sleepers are necessary to take care of us comfortably.
The old days, when I travelled with fifty men,
have gone long ago, and now we should not think of touring
with an orchestra of less than eighty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time for spring tours seems to be passing, however,
as the Western cities are beginning to minister to the needs
of their respective communities with their own excellent
orchestras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years I accepted long summer engagements
with two concerts every day, first at Willow Grove near
Philadelphia, and then at Ravinia Park, on the North
Shore near Chicago. The former became a great educational
factor, as Philadelphia at that time had no orchestra
of its own. Willow Grove Park is situated seventeen
miles from that city and was built by the Rapid Transit
Company in order to stimulate travel on their trolley
lines. The first season, for which a military band had
been engaged, had not proven a success, and I was invited
the following year in the hope that a symphonic
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
organization might do better. I began by giving them
popular programmes of good music with a regular symphony
night every Monday and a Wagner programme
every Friday evening, with excellent results. Our audiences
usually numbered from fifteen to twenty thousand.
The Rapid Transit Company, realizing the importance
of the concerts, promptly built a huge open-air auditorium
after my own design, consisting of only a roof
on pillars connecting with the shell in which the orchestra
was placed. The acoustics proved exceedingly good and
the out-of-doors atmosphere was preserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continued these concerts for seven seasons, thereby
developing an audience for symphonic music which
eventually and inevitably demanded a resident orchestra
of its own. To-day the Philadelphia orchestra, under the
leadership of Leopold Stokowski, ranks as one of the
foremost of our country. Its concerts are crowded to
the doors and I like to think that our seven years of
pioneer work in Willow Grove have helped to lay its
foundations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also conducted a series of concerts at Ravinia Park,
organized by the Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railway
to serve a similar commercial purpose. Chicago had,
of course, enjoyed for years the splendid winter concerts
of the Chicago Orchestra, first under Theodore Thomas
and then under his successor, Frederick Stock, but this
was the first time that symphonic concerts were given
during the summer amid such charming surroundings
on the borders of Lake Michigan. These concerts proved
exceedingly popular, the audiences consisting not only
of the North Shore residents but of thousands who came
out from Chicago on trains and trolleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After several years of this work, however, the incessant
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
daily concerts, coming after an arduous winter season,
began to pall on my musical nerves. I ran a real danger,
if I continued, of becoming nothing but a musical routinier,
with an inevitable loss of the enthusiasm and freshness
which is an absolute necessity for the interpreter.
I therefore gave up all conducting during the summer
months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I founded the Damrosch Opera Company in 1895, and
the harassing question of how to maintain my orchestra
seemed solved, for, during the first year, my opera season
lasted thirteen weeks and during the following three
years, from twenty to thirty weeks each. This not only
enabled me to maintain a beautifully trained orchestra
for the Wagner operas, but also gave to my symphony
performances a greater finish. The orchestra was now
under my exclusive control and could rehearse as often
as the endowed orchestra of Major Higginson. But as
it was the opera that enabled me to give my men such a
long engagement, its needs had to control all other arrangements,
and gradually the regular sequence of my
winter concerts in New York began to suffer. I could
not keep my opera company in New York except for a
limited period each year, and therefore had to fill in much
of my time in Philadelphia, Boston, and the larger cities
of the South and Middle West. In 1899 I was therefore
finally compelled to give up the regular subscription
series of our New York concerts and the New York Symphony
Orchestra became a part of my travelling operatic
organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made this sacrifice with a heavy heart, but at that
time it was the only solution. An orchestra devoted only
to concerts could not be maintained without an endowment,
and that I did not have at the time, while the
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
length of my Wagner opera season enabled me not only
to give my men a good engagement but to have the pick
of the best musicians in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From then on until 1903 most of our playing of symphonic
music was only on our spring concert tours and
at irregular intervals in New York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1900 Maurice Grau asked me to conduct the Wagner
operas at the Metropolitan, and in the spring of 1902,
at the close of my second season with him, I received an
invitation from the New York Philharmonic Society to
become its conductor. This invitation was a great surprise
to me, as the Philharmonic had been, ever since my
father’s day, the rival orchestra. In many ways it
seemed a flattering proposition, as it was the oldest organization
of its kind in America and had had an honorable
history. Under the leadership of Theodore Thomas
and later on of Anton Seidl, the audiences had been large
and its affairs had prospered. It had always been a co-operative
association, composed of the members of the
orchestra, who had complete control of its affairs, receiving
no salaries, but dividing the profits equally among
themselves at the end of each season. I accepted the
conductorship, but found very soon that my acceptance
was a blunder. The society had come upon evil days, and
under its last conductor attendance had dwindled to less
than one-half. Of the membership of the orchestra only
the skeleton remained, and I found to my amazement
that of the hundred players at the concerts, less than
fifty were actual members of the organization, the rest
being engaged from outside, and often changed from one
concert to another. Some of the members were old men
who should no longer have played in the orchestra at all;
but they were devoted to the concerts of the society, and
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
as the orchestra was regulated by their votes, they naturally
would not vote themselves out of it. Many of
them had been excellent musicians and were personally
upright men, but age, alas, is no respecter of technic,
and the fingers of the left hand and the muscles of the bow
arm gradually stiffen with advancing years. Most of
the wind instruments were outsiders and therefore could
not be properly controlled regarding their attendance at
rehearsals and concerts, while, on the contrary, nearly all
of the first violins were old members, several of whom
were no longer fit to play first violin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact was that Major Higginson, of Boston, with
his permanent orchestra composed of young men, many
of them the best of their kind, with their daily rehearsals
and at least seventy-five symphony concerts a season,
had set a new standard of orchestral technic which the
old Philharmonic, under its archaic conditions, could not
hope to equal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only solution seemed to me to lie in gathering together
a fund large enough to produce the same conditions
and results as Higginson had achieved in the Boston
Orchestra, and, above all, to put the management of the
Philharmonic into the hands of a committee which should
not be composed of members of the orchestra, but of
music lovers and guarantors of the fund.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I discussed this idea with several of my friends and
some old subscribers and friends of the Philharmonic at
a meeting held on January 5, 1903, and it was resolved
to obtain a fund of fifty thousand dollars a year for four
years, to be administered for the benefit of the Philharmonic
Society as a permanent orchestra fund by a
board of fifteen or more trustees, but it was not to be
subject to the control of the Philharmonic Society.
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
This fund was to be the beginning of an endowment for
a permanent orchestra, of which the Philharmonic Society
was to be the nucleus. The terms of the deed of trust
under which the fund was to be held were to be determined
by a committee of three, consisting of Mr.
Samuel Untermyer, Mr. John Notman, and Mr. E.
Francis Hyde.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the Philharmonic Orchestra were not
unfavorably disposed toward our scheme. The idea of
being guaranteed a yearly salary instead of sharing
problematic yearly profits, naturally appealed to them;
but when our committee explained to them that, under
the terms of such an endowment, several of the playing
members would have to resign their places because in the
opinion of the committee they had passed the age of
usefulness, they rebelled. Nor did they feel inclined to
give up the absolute management of their concerts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the most respected members of the Philharmonic
Orchestra were two old violinists. The one,
Richard Arnold, vice-president of the society, had been
concert master under my father twenty-five years before
and still officiated in that position in the Philharmonic.
The other, August Roebbelin, who had played as first
violinist in the orchestra for nearly forty years, had also
acted as manager of the society and unselfishly given his
best energies to its affairs. As a violinist, however, he
had passed his time of usefulness. Our committee, perhaps
rather bluntly, informed the Philharmonic committee
that under the reorganization the selection of the
orchestra must be left in the hands of the conductor and
that Mr. Arnold would have to content himself with a
second position at the first stand, so that a younger artist
could become concert master, and that several of the first
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
violinists, among them Mr. Roebbelin, would have to be
retired altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had made it particularly clear that my selection as
conductor for the following year was not in any way a
necessary part of the reorganization scheme, as it seemed
to me that the only way to achieve a real permanent orchestra
for New York was to unite the conflicting factions
and to let the choice of conductor be made after the
organization had been properly placed upon a sound and
comprehensive basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lengthy negotiations the Philharmonic, in a letter
of February 28, 1903, definitely refused the offer of the
reorganization committee because, as their secretary expressed
it, the amendments required by our committee
“would so change the nature of the society as to seriously
interfere with the control of its affairs by its members,
which has always been its vital principle, and that
the future prosperity of the society would thereby be
impaired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I had no desire to continue another year with the
orchestra on the basis of existing conditions, I wrote to
Mr. Arnold and requested that my name be not proposed
as a candidate for the following year. I had been in a
very delicate position during all this time, as I had
grown quite fond personally of some of the very men
whom, for artistic reasons, it was necessary to retire. It
was not in human nature that they should have seen
themselves as others saw them, or heard themselves as
others heard them, and at our rehearsals and concerts
they all certainly gave the best that was in them. The
changes which I had proposed were necessary, however,
if the society expected to continue its existence as an orchestral
body.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
For a few years they staved off the inevitable by engaging
for each season a number of European guest conductors.
This served as a stop-gap, as it diverted the attention
of the audience from the deficiencies in the orchestra
to the different and interesting personalities and
musical specialties of the conductors. But then a reorganization
plan, exactly on the lines originally proposed
by me, completely eliminating the power of the orchestral
players to manage the concerts or to select the
players in the orchestra, was accepted by them, and to-day
the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society is organized
and successfully working on exactly the same basis as the
New York Symphony Society and the Boston Orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For me the rejection of our reorganization plan was at
the time naturally a great disappointment, but not for
long, as my efforts had made new friends for me and in
a new direction, which eventually proved a turning-point
in my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On March 19, 1903, I received a letter which read as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I have been instructed by the members of the Permanent Orchestra
Fund Committee to express to you their appreciation of the
spirit of unselfishness and of loyalty to the highest artistic interests
which has characterized your attitude during the negotiations which
have been in progress between our Committee and the Philharmonic
Society. We regret that a consolidation of our interests has proved
impossible, but we relinquish the plan we had in view with the greatest
respect and admiration for your broad attitude of mind in regard

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Years before I had met Mr. Flagler through his friend,
Max Alvary, when the latter was a member of the Damrosch
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
Opera Company, but the meeting was quite casual
and I had not seen him again until the meetings of the
Philharmonic Orchestra Fund Committee, of which he
had become a member. I had been singularly attracted
by him and his gentle and quiet, almost diffident manner.
He had been a great lover of music all his life and had
found in his wife Anne an enthusiastic companion in
his love for the art. As the reorganization scheme of the
Philharmonic Orchestra gradually unfolded itself, he became
more and more interested in it as the right solution
of the problem of developing a symphony orchestra in
New York which should be the equal of the Boston Symphony
or the Chicago Orchestra, and he was ready to
help such a scheme to the fulness of his financial ability.
Very quickly after the failure of this project, many of the
forces concerned recruited themselves anew, and a large
proportion of the would-be guarantors turned to me with
the suggestion to reorganize the New York Symphony
Orchestra, and by subsidizing all the first players and
thereby binding them to the orchestra, make a new beginning
in the right direction. During the interregnum of
three years the orchestra had maintained itself fairly
well through the earnings of our long spring tours and
summer engagements, but I joyfully hailed this opportunity
to renew the New York winter concerts. A reorganization
of the Symphony Society of New York was quickly
effected by the re-election of most of the old directors
and of many new ones. My old and loyal friend, Daniel
Frohman, at whose theatre I had given many a Wagner
lecture in the years past, accepted the presidency pro
tem and was of great assistance in procuring outside work
for the members of the orchestra. He was succeeded by
Mr. Samuel Sanford, a man of real musical ability, who
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
had founded the musical department at Yale University
and had contributed liberally to many musical
enterprises. He immediately became one of the largest
guarantors of our orchestra fund.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We accordingly resumed our New York concerts under
the best possible auspices with an enthusiastic directorate
and a large subscription list. I was, however, not satisfied
with the wood-wind players at that time available
in New York. The Musical Union, which controlled all
orchestral players, had made the influx of good musicians
from Europe almost an impossibility by insisting that a
player must have lived at least six months in this country
before he could join the union, and that until he became
a member no other member of the union would be allowed
to play with him. As all orchestral engagements in
opera, concert, or theatre were in the hands of union
men, this meant that the newcomer would have to starve
for six months before he could begin to earn a dollar toward
his maintenance. This law was not enforced by
the union men for patriotic reasons, as most of them had
been born in Europe, but because they feared the possible
competition for the positions they monopolized. The
best wood-wind players at that time—and, generally
speaking, this applies to-day—were French or Belgian.
The Conservatoire of Paris has for years produced very
superior artists on these instruments. The Boston Orchestra,
which is non-union, had several among its members,
and their exquisite tone and beautiful phrasing always
particularly enraged me because, owing to the union
restrictions, I could not have players of equal merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I determined therefore to throw down the gantlet to
the union by deliberately going to France to engage the
five best artists I could find in flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon,
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
and trumpet, demonstrate their superior excellence
to anything we could obtain in New York at that time,
and through the pressure of public opinion—and, above
all, the necessity of artistic competition with the Boston
Symphony—force the union to accept these men as
members. When the Frenchmen arrived, the rage among
the members of the New York union knew no bounds.
I had a summer engagement for the orchestra on one of
the roof gardens, but the union refused to let them play
with us except as “soloists,” and I determined to take the
matter higher up to the annual convention of the National
Federation of Musicians, which was held in Detroit in the
summer of 1905.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found the national delegates much more amenable
to reason than my New York colleagues. There were
more real Americans among them and many of them listened
to my pleadings with interest and sympathy. The
president of the federation, Joseph N. Weber, is a man of
real intellectual ability; and while he and I have had some
violent quarrels and disagreements during these many
years, and while I have sometimes denounced him to his
face as a fanatic and he has given me tit for tat, I must
acknowledge that he not only has had the ability to build
up a remarkable organization of great power, but has
often acted with great fairness in disputes that have come
up between the directors of the New York Musical Union
and myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Federation decided in my favor and gave
me the permission to incorporate these five Frenchmen
in my orchestra and to enroll them as members of the
New York union, but as I had “sinned against the laws
of the federation in bringing them over from a foreign
country,” I was fined one thousand dollars. It was,
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
however, intimated to me privately that if I would return
to the next convention of the federation, which was to be
held in Boston the following summer, I would in all
probability receive a remission of the greater part of this
fine. It is needless for me to say that I never saw any
part of that one thousand dollars again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to New York jubilant and my French
players proved themselves such superior artists that, together
with our other excellent members, many of whom
had been with me for years, the orchestra quickly took
rank among the best in the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leader of my first violins was Mr. David Mannes.
I had discovered him a few years before at one of the
New York theatres, where he was a member of the little
orchestra and where I heard him play a solo charmingly
between the first and second acts. The beautiful quality
of his tone, and a fine sensitiveness to the melos of the
work he was playing, attracted me and I engaged him
for the last stand of the first violins. From there he was
quickly promoted until he occupied the position at the
first stand of concert master. He married my sister Clara,
a pianist of fine accomplishment. Their sonata recitals
have become models of intimate unity in chamber-music
playing, and several years ago they founded the David
Mannes Music School. This encroached so much upon
his time and energy as to compel him to resign his position
in the New York Symphony Orchestra, which he had
held so honorably for many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each year the guarantee fund for the maintenance of
the orchestra was increased by the supporters of the New
York Symphony Society, and more and more men were
engaged on regular weekly salaries. At last my dream was
realized, and New York had an orchestra organized on the
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
same lines as the Boston and Chicago Orchestras, devoted
exclusively to symphonic music and assembling
daily for rehearsal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fund at this time reached over fifty thousand
dollars a year, mainly subscribed by the directors of our
organization. Several of these had been supporters from
my father’s time, among them Isaac N. Seligman, who,
with his family, had been interested in music in New
York for many years. Others had come into the organization
when I became its conductor and had remained
loyal supporters and close friends from that time on.
Among them were: Richard Welling, a director since 1886,
a well-known lawyer and reformer in municipal politics,
and who as a member of the Naval Reserves promptly
enlisted as an ensign when we entered the Great War,
although he was then well over fifty years of age; Miss
Mary R. Callender and Miss Caroline de Forest who had
been directors since 1885. Miss Callender further signalized
her affection for the orchestra by leaving fifty
thousand dollars to the pension and sick fund after her
death in 1919. The complete list of the subscribers to
the fund at the time was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ideal conditions under which I now worked gave
me the opportunity to carry out several artistic plans
which I had had for a long time. The first of these was a
Beethoven cycle, in which I gave not only all the nine
symphonies in chronological order, but other compositions
of Beethoven, some of which had not yet appeared
on the concert programmes of New York. Accordingly,
in the winter of 1909, I prepared six programmes composed
of Beethoven’s works, and at the last concert gave
a double performance of his “Ninth Symphony.” This
was a real <span class='it'>tour de force</span>, but not original with me. During
the summer of 1887, which I had spent with von Bülow
in study of the Beethoven symphonies, he had told me of
having given such a double performance in Berlin and
that the results had been very remarkable, inasmuch as
at the second hearing, the audience had been able the
more perfectly to grasp many of the intricacies of this
“Hamlet” among symphonic dramas. Our double performance
caused a good deal of comment, most of which
was very favorable. Between the two performances the
orchestra and chorus were refreshed with hot coffee and
sandwiches, and as the work takes about an hour and ten
minutes to perform, the repetition, together with a half-hour
of rest between, brought the final tumultuous outburst
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
of the choral “Ode to Joy” to eleven o’clock. Notwithstanding
the lateness of the hour, the audience began
a great demonstration of approval, applauding and shouting
for many minutes; but while I and my performers
took some of this as ours by right, I have always felt that
the audience intended a good part of it as directed toward
themselves for having so nobly endured the great
strain which I had put upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first Beethoven Festival ever given in
New York, and a few years later I organized a Brahms
Festival on similar lines. I directed his four symphonies,
the ingratiating Zimbalist playing the “Violin Concerto,”
Wilhelm Backhaus the great “B-Flat Piano Concerto,”
and my brother with the chorus of the Oratorio Society
conducting a very beautiful performance of the “Requiem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such festivals devoted exclusively to the work of one
composer are a great lesson to the serious music lover,
and I think that as Beethoven represents almost the
alpha and certainly the omega of symphonic music, there
should be repetitions of Beethoven cycles every few
years. I have never been able to understand why it
should not be similarly possible to give Shakespearian
cycles in spring, in which all of our best actors could combine
to make up ideal casts. We should certainly make
American children as familiar with Shakespeare’s great
tragedies as, for instance, the children of Germany, to
whom Shakespeare is much more of a household word
than he is to those of this country or England. If music
can find Flaglers and Higginsons to endow it as an educational
necessity, why cannot similar men be found to
do the same for the drama and thus help to lift it as an
educational factor from its painfully weak position to
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
which the necessities of making it a paying institution
have driven it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During all these years my relations with Mr. and Mrs.
Flagler became more and more intimate. I had never
met such people in my entire life. Their devotion to and
interest in the orchestra increased constantly, and Mr.
Flagler’s contributions to the fund became greater and
greater as the needs of the orchestra increased. But his
help was offered with a shyness, as if it had been the orchestra
that conferred the benefit upon him. He also
took over a work which I had always detested more than
anything else, and that is the collection of funds. As the
expenses of the orchestra increased with the years, it
became necessary to collect money from outside sources
beyond the large sums already contributed by the directors
of the society. With constant good humor,
patience, and infinite tact Mr. Flagler, whose own donations
to the fund were greater in proportion to his income
than those of many others, would write letters or
call personally on well-to-do musical patrons to collect
perhaps a few hundred dollars toward the fund, and he
would be inordinately proud of his success as a financier
and collector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally even his infinite patience wore out under this
yearly strain and this manifested itself in a very remarkable
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1914 he quietly informed me that he
had decided to assume the entire financial responsibility
of the orchestra himself and to contribute all necessary
funds for its proper maintenance. This amount was double
what would have been considered necessary ten years
before, but salaries of orchestral players and other expenses
in connection with the giving of concerts had increased
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
enormously and it was Mr. Flagler’s desire that,
while there should be no waste, the affairs of the orchestra
should be managed in such liberal fashion that the artistic
needs could first be considered in shaping its policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This magnificent and unique act naturally created a
great excitement in the musical circles of New York, and
Mr. Flagler was universally acclaimed as its foremost
musical citizen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have a characteristic letter of his, dated August 31,
1914, in which he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Indeed I am not overmodest about my gift to the Symphony
Society. It is not that, but what I am doing is so little in comparison
with what the <span class='it'>real</span> makers of music, creators and interpreters
like yourself do for the betterment of the world through their
art, that it doesn’t deserve to be thought of. I <span class='it'>am</span> proud and happy
in the thought that I may be the means of helping you to put before
the world your ideas in regard to the interpretations of the masters
and to bring the God-given art of music to many who would not
otherwise have its uplifting and consoling power, and that is what we
are doing together. You shall be free as never before to work out
your own ideas unfettered by thoughts of the financial necessities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since then the society has pursued the even tenor of its
way and, freed from all financial worries, has contributed
much to the cause of music. The orchestra plays over a
hundred symphony concerts during the winter, in New
York and elsewhere. These include a series of Sunday-afternoon
concerts at Æolian Hall, Thursday-afternoon
and Friday-evening concerts at Carnegie Hall, and a
series of young people’s concerts and another of children’s
concerts. There are also subscription concerts in
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and
Rochester, and several tours every winter to Canada and
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
the Middle West. During the war Mr. Flagler often
gave the services of the orchestra for charities connected
with the war, and several times donated the gross receipts
of our regular concerts to such organizations as the
American Friends of Musicians in France, in which he
and his wife became very much interested. But perhaps
the climax in the history of the orchestra was reached in
its great European tour in the spring of 1920. To this I
shall devote a separate chapter following one on my experiences
in France during the Great War.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span><h1>XV</h1></div>

<h3>THE GREAT WAR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When America finally entered the Great War I was,
like most of my fellow citizens, anxious to do something
to help, and therefore shared the restlessness and discontent
which most men of maturer years felt because they
were not “too proud” but too old to fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of music lovers had formed an organization,
“American Friends of Musicians in France,” the object of
which was to collect money with which to help the families
of musicians in France who were suffering or destitute
because of the war. Through my French colleagues
we had heard of many such cases—some of the most famous
musicians were at the front, in the trenches, and in
the hospitals, doing their share just as did the men in all
the other professions and callings. Several organizations
had been formed in France to help toward maintaining
their families, but much remained to be done, and
through our society, which aroused immediate response
in America, we were raising considerable sums and expected
to continue this work until the end of the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been elected president, and while discussing with
our committee the best ways and means of helping the
older French musicians, it was brought out that many of
them were too proud to accept alms. What they really
wanted was opportunity to work in their profession, as
the constant air raids and bombardments of Paris had
almost entirely stopped the giving of lessons and concerts.
During our discussion Henri Casadesus, a French
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
musician who was then on a concert tour in America
with his Society of Ancient Instruments, and who had
given us much valuable information regarding conditions
in France, suggested that an orchestra could be formed of
such musicians as were still in Paris, which might be used
to travel around the country to the various camps in
which our huge army was forming and drilling, and to give
our soldiers good popular music during their hours of rest
and recreation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was suggested that a French conductor be engaged
to lead this orchestra, but Casadesus asked whether it
would not be possible for me to go over and take charge
personally. He thought that the French Government
would look on this idea very favorably, and through the
Ministère des Beaux Arts would give us every assistance
possible toward the forming of the orchestra and its
transportation through the country. Needless to say, my
heart leaped with joy at this suggestion. One step led
to another, and Mr. Harry Harkness Flagler immediately
and with characteristic generosity donated a check large
enough to pay the entire expenses and salaries of a French
orchestra of fifty men for six weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan was outlined to the National War Work
Council of the Young Men’s Christian Association, who
accepted it with enthusiasm, and to the French High
Commission in Washington, of which Mr. Tardieu was at
that time the chief. He sent one of his staff, the Marquis
de Polignac, to New York to discuss and arrange details,
and immediately cabled to Paris to obtain for me the
necessary authority to enter France and to proceed with
the plan. The acting director of the Ministère des Beaux
Arts was at that time M. Alfred Cortot, the distinguished
pianist, and within a week he cabled us that he could
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
place at my disposal the Pasdeloup Orchestra of fifty
men who would be ready on my arrival to travel throughout
our recreation centres, camps, and hospitals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As no civilian who was not in government employ could
sail for France except under the auspices of one of the
welfare organizations, I was to sail as a war worker for
the Y. M. C. A., whose entertainment division was under
the direction of Mr. Thomas McLane, an earnest, patriotic
citizen of New York who gave his entire time enthusiastically
to this arduous work. A few weeks before
sailing, however, the war situation became so serious
that the possibility of carrying out our scheme seemed
very doubtful, but Mr. McLane and his chief, Mr.
William Sloane, felt strongly that I should go over anyhow,
look over the field, and make myself useful in one
way or another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regulations of the Y. M. C. A. demanded that each
one of their workers should submit an indorsement by
three well-known American citizens, and as I had the
honor of many years’ acquaintance with Theodore Roosevelt,
I gave his name as one who might be willing to testify
to my Americanism. The letter which he wrote is so
characteristic that I am vain enough to reprint it here.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Sagamore Hill, May 4th, 1918.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The assurance of a safe-conduct from the Ministère
des Etrangères was a rather important item as I had been
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
born in Germany, even though only the first nine years
of my life had been spent there. My father emigrated
to America in 1871, and as I had received my education
here, had lived in America ever since, and had married
an American, I had never felt myself anything but an
American and of the most enthusiastic variety. When the
Germans invaded Belgium, when they sank the <span class='it'>Lusitania</span>,
and when they seemed to have broken all laws of international
relations, I expressed myself, both personally
and in newspaper interviews, so strongly that long before
we entered the war several Berlin newspapers violently
took me to task and honored me by calling me a renegade
and a traitor to the country of my birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an understanding between our country and
France that no American civilian of German birth should
be permitted to enter France except by special permission
of either M. Clemenceau or M. Pichon, then Minister of
Foreign Affairs. The French high commissioner cabled to
the latter and in most cordial terms recommended that I
be permitted to enter France, both because of my office
as president of the Society of American Friends of Musicians
in France, and because of a life-long admiration
for French music, which I had demonstrated for thirty-three
years by producing in our country nearly every
important symphonic work that French composers had
written before and within that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. Pichon promptly cabled the necessary visé and
with all proper credentials I set sail on June 15, 1918, on
the French steamship <span class='it'>La Lorraine</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship’s passengers were almost entirely soldiers and
war workers. There were two hundred and fifty Belgian
soldiers with their officers returning to France after three
years spent in Russia, and who, when the revolution broke
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
out, had after incredible hardships reached Vladivostok,
sailing from there to California. There were Polish soldiers
on their way to join the Foreign Legion of the French
army and there were dozens of Red Cross, Y. M. C. A.,
K. of C., and S. A. workers. There were not more than
a dozen civilians, among them my friend, Melville Stone,
director of the Associated Press, and M. Sulzer, the Swiss
minister then accredited to our country. It was strange
to be on a transatlantic steamer without any idle rich,
tourists, or commercial travellers; and the large guns
mounted fore and aft with a gun crew watching, ready
day and night, gave one a grim foretaste of the war raging
on the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the first day out Stone told me that M. Sulzer
would like to meet me. I expressed my pleasure and
laughingly said: “I will promise not to ask him any
questions regarding the Swiss citizenship of Doctor Karl
Muck.” Stone must have repeated this to Sulzer, for
immediately after our introduction he said: “I want to
tell you that Doctor Muck had no more claim to Swiss
citizenship than you have. The facts are as follows:
After the Franco-Prussian war, Muck’s father—a Bavarian
living in Munich—was afraid that Bavaria would
become completely Prussianized, and, as he had no liking
for that country, he preferred to emigrate to Switzerland,
where he acquired citizenship which at that time was very
easy, as Switzerland was glad to receive the intelligentsia
of other countries. His son Karl left Switzerland as a
boy to be educated in Germany, and never returned.
He went to a German university, studied music, became
an orchestral conductor, and as such officiated in various
German opera-houses, until he became conductor and
Generalmusikdirektor at the Royal Opera in Berlin.
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
There he remained for many years and when the war
broke out offered his services to the German Ministry of
War in a clerical capacity. The Swiss Government does
not recognize him as a citizen and refuses him the protection
which such citizenship would afford him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our journey was uneventful. We saw no submarines
and, what was still more important, no submarines saw
us. When we reached the “danger zone” some hundred
miles from the coast of France, I was solemnly appointed
a committee of one to inform M. Sulzer that as he was
the Swiss minister and as such the representative of
German interests in the United States during the war, we
intended to bind him to the foremast and play a searchlight
on him and on a large Swiss flag hanging over his
head, during the two or three nights before we dropped anchor
in the Gironde. He smilingly expressed himself as so
willing to act in this capacity as our guardian angel, that we
refrained and trusted to luck, which indeed never failed us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dropped anchor at the mouth of the Gironde to take
on the usual officials, among them the secret-service men
who were to look over the passengers while we waited the
turn of the tide before proceeding up-stream to Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a beautiful sunlit evening, and as I was standing
at the rail watching the tide, which ran out to sea like a
mill-race, suddenly there was a splash and we saw one
of the Belgian soldiers lying on the water, his face downward
and his arms and legs outstretched and motionless.
He was being carried out to sea with incredible speed by
the tide, and it was evident that he was trying to commit
suicide, as he made no effort to struggle. The sailors were
all busy elsewhere getting out the mail-bags and trunks,
and for a few minutes nothing seemed to be done. Suddenly
there was another splash as, from the deck above,
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
a man dove after the Belgian. It was Lieutenant Shirk,
an aviator in our marines, who had not even taken the
time to throw off his coat or leather puttees. A life-saving
belt had been thrown just previously and floated with the
tide several yards ahead of the Belgian soldier, but both
were carried along so swiftly that it was some time before
Lieutenant Shirk could reach him. As he approached,
the Belgian promptly kicked at him, and it took several
moments before he was overpowered and dragged toward
the life-belt. In the meantime a boat had been lowered,
but so swift is the tide in these waters that when the boat
reached the two men, they seemed like two small black
spots in the distance. The excitement and enthusiasm
when they were brought back to the ship may easily be
imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant Shirk proved to be a well-to-do young business
man from Indianapolis, who when the war broke out
had immediately enlisted, leaving a wife and children
and large important business interests to give himself
whole-heartedly to the service of his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you “tell this story to the marines” they will refuse
to acknowledge that it is anything extraordinary, and they
will also tell you that that is just a way they have of
dealing with any emergency on land or sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sad part of this heroic rescue is that a few days
afterward, meeting one of the Belgian officers in Paris, he
told me that the soldier, soon after landing, had succeeded
in his effort at self-destruction, and had shot himself in a
fit of despondency. He had been away from Belgium for
four years, and during all that time had had no news of
his wife or children; his little farm was in the hands of
the Germans, and there was neither hope nor desire to
live left in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
We all had to assemble in the saloon of the ship to
present our passports, and when it came to my turn I was
politely told to go to my cabin with two secret-service
men, that they might question me further regarding my
mission. One of these men was silent, but the other a
very voluble, polite Frenchman. But even the visé by
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the French High Commission
did not seem quite to satisfy him. The fact that
I had been born in Germany evidently impressed him unfavorably.
He asked me finally: “Do you intend to take
any money out of France?” “On the contrary,” I replied,
“here is a letter of credit, every cent of which is to
be used on French orchestra musicians.” In corroboration
I showed him the cable from the Ministère des Beaux
Arts offering me the use of the Pasdeloup Orchestra, the
conductor of which was M. Rhene Baton. The face of
my secret-service man suddenly became wreathed in
smiles. “Ah!” he said, “M. Baton! Why, before the
war I used to play third horn in his orchestra in Bordeaux.
Everything is all right.” With a bow he handed
me back my passport, and at this point his silent companion
suddenly gave me a most genial wink, the nationality
of which could not be mistaken. I said: “You are
American.” “Sure!” he answered, and thus I was enabled
to land at last in France with colors flying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning saw me in Paris at the little hotel
“France et Choiseul,” to which I had always gone on my
visits to Paris during twenty-five years preceding. I
found the same courteous, smiling directeur, M. Mantel,
to receive me. Even the old canary-bird, hanging in the
courtyard, was still living, but either corpulence or old
age had stopped his musical demonstrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would take a man of much greater eloquence than I
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
can claim, to give an adequate picture of Paris at that
time. It seemed to me more beautiful and more noble
than I had ever seen it during my many visits in times of
peace. The streets were almost empty, there were no
tourists, no pleasure-seekers, no idlers, and therefore
that part of Parisian life which usually stands out so
prominently and which, alas, is generally the only part
that the average visitor sees, was entirely absent. One
saw only the French people going about their daily tasks
and the soldiers of France and her allies. The Champs-Élysées,
the Tuileries, and, above all, the Jardin de
Luxembourg seemed more charming than ever, but the
tragic note was that the lovely children who in former
times crowded these gardens were all gone. Constant air
raids and the frequent bombardments by the “Big
Bertha” had driven them away. It was said that a
million and a half people had left Paris, and that, owing
to the nearness of the German armies, the entire evacuation
of the civilian population was imminent. Rumors
had it, furthermore, that all the banks had sent their securities
to Orleans and that the embassies and various
relief organizations were ready to leave Paris at a few
hours’ notice. There was not the least sign of panic, but
an indescribable sadness brooded over the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the long twilight, which is the most beautiful
time to see Paris, when the sky and the clouds seem to
hover most intimately and caressingly over its wonderful
vistas, I used to take long walks along the banks of the
Seine. Even the complete darkness at night, the absence
of all electric lights or signs, with only an occasional half-hidden
blue lamp here and there, made the city more
picturesque and wonderful. It was almost as if the centuries
of civilization and modern inventions had been
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
swept away and we were back again in the time of the
<span class='it'>Grand Monarque</span>, when Paris was only dimly lighted by
faintly flickering oil lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, I soon made the acquaintance of the nocturnal
air raids, and when the sirens placed at various
high buildings of the city sounded their horrible warning
that the German Gothas were approaching, every inhabitant
was supposed to seek shelter in the cellars. I did
this dutifully for two or three nights, but as it meant
leaving one’s bed at about 11.30 or 12 and returning at
about 1.30 or 2 <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. M.</span>, I gradually realized that my own
pet cowardice was more the fear of not getting enough
sleep, as I was completely knocked out during the daytime
by the lack of it. After weighing the alternatives
carefully I decided to take the small risk of remaining in
my bed and getting a good night’s rest in consequence;
and having solved this question to my complete satisfaction,
I used to wake up on hearing the warning of the
sirens, stretch myself comfortably, and immediately go
to sleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gatherings in the <span class='it'>abri</span> of our hotel were, however,
quite amusing. The guests used to assemble in the wine-cellar,
which was protected by walls several feet thick,
and in which we could further fortify ourselves by sampling
a bottle or two of the excellent claret and burgundy
which it contained. If one of our little number was an
army officer we would make him tell us his experiences
at the front, and listen with awe and eager interest until
the bugles of the fire department outside sounded the
“all-clear” signal. Then the old portier, whom we used
to call “Papa Joffre,” would come down and, with the
sweetest smile on his dear old face, assure us that all was
safe and we could creep back again to our beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
In the meantime I began to investigate the conditions
under which to carry out our plan of giving orchestral
concerts for our soldiers at their rest camps and in the
hospitals, and soon discovered that the recent developments
at the front would make it exceedingly difficult,
if not impossible. Paris was in a state of great depression.
The enemy were threatening the city, our rest
camps were empty, and our soldiers were being drilled
furiously in order to put them as soon as possible either
in the line or behind the line as reserves. Every available
inch of space on the railroads had to be used for
military purposes, for the transportation of men and material,
and to have intruded an orchestra of fifty men
with cumbersome luggage, musical instruments, etc.,
would have been a nuisance instead of a service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Government, through its various departments
with which I came into contact, especially the
Ministry of Fine Arts and the French High Commission,
received me with the greatest courtesy and kindness. M.
Cortot, at the Beaux Arts, had taken steps to procure an
orchestra for me and I was already getting the full benefit
of the friendliness for everything American which,
after the first entry of our troops into the fighting-line at
Seicheprey, Belleau Wood, and Château-Thierry developed
into an enthusiasm, the like of which cannot be
imagined. I saw the change from deepest despondency
to greatest optimism come over the city like a wave, and
especially after the heroic stand of our men at Château-Thierry
there was nothing which an American could
possibly want that a Frenchman was not willing to give
to him with both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the morning of the Fourth of July a Franco-American
demonstration had been arranged which was to culminate
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
in a parade of French and American troops from
the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-Élysées to the
Place de la Concorde. I was naturally among the crowds
of eager spectators who lined the avenue to greet our
troops, which included a company of our marines who
had fought at the front but a few days before. This was
literally the first time that I had seen a crowd of people
in Paris, and it marked in significant fashion the change
from the gloom that had hovered over the city when I
first arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paris had been decorated as only the French know how,
and the noble vistas of the city looked their best under a
glorious sky of blue slightly flecked with white clouds.
In the waiting crowd there were no young men, not even
middle-aged, for all these had been at the front for four
years, but there were old men, boys, and women of all
ages down to a charming little girl of twelve, evidently of
the poorer class, who was standing by my side on tip-toe
with excitement. She could speak a few words of
English and every now and then, with the sweetest and
shyest glance at me, she would demonstrate her knowledge
of our tongue, and then supplement it with more
voluble French, as she pointed out to me the various wonders
of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overhead some of the most expert of the French airmen
were flying backward and forward, looping the loop,
dipping the dip, and executing marvellous manœuvres
as they swooped down, sometimes almost brushing the
trees on either side of the magnificent avenue, all to the
great delight of the crowds awaiting the coming of our
soldiers. As the mounted police of Paris, a splendid body
of men, came down the avenue, the excitement became
intense, and when our khaki-clad boys swept into view
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
the enthusiasm exceeded all bounds. Young girls, with
their arms literally banked with flowers, ran across the
empty spaces cleared by the police, and began to distribute
them among our soldiers who, looking straight ahead,
awkwardly grabbed the flowers, stuck them into the tunics,
or held them in the hand not occupied with the rifle, all
the time keeping their alignment with the most rigid
discipline, just as if they were ignorant of the sweetest
tribute that one nation could offer another. The whole
scene was so indescribably touching that every one in the
crowd, including myself, stood there with the tears rolling
down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my other side stood an American bandmaster who
recognized me, and while we were waiting for the parade
he implored me to do something for the bandsmen in the
American army in France. He told me that he had drilled
his little band of twenty-eight men for six months before
being sent overseas, that they had continued to work
faithfully during their stay in France, and that they had
achieved a good standard of efficiency. But, according to
old American army custom, they had been sent into the
firing-line at Seicheprey as stretcher-bearers, and in consequence
so many had been either killed, wounded, or
shell-shocked that his band had become completely disorganized.
His regiment was in consequence without
music, and he had been detached and sent to Paris as
general purchasing agent for musical instruments. He
said: “It takes at least six months to train a good bandsman,
while a stretcher-bearer can be trained in as many
hours. We serve a real purpose, while the men are in
camp, in taking their minds away from the drudgery and
monotony of army life. Our music cheers them; a silent
camp is almost unendurable. Can’t you persuade General
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
Pershing to change this custom, just as the British and
other nations have done?” I told him that I sympathized
with his views, that it seemed to me wrong to use
the band for any other purpose than music, except in case
of absolute military necessity, but that I was without any
official connection with the army and so did not think
that I could be of much service to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the parade was ended and the crowds dispersed,
the little French girl on my right said “Good-by” to me
in English, ever so prettily, and then very shyly pressed
into my hand as a parting token a tiny little American
flag that she herself had painted on a bit of cotton, the
stars and stripes on one side and the French tricolor on
the other. Needless to say I still possess this charming
symbol as a <span class='it'>porte-bonheur</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had arranged to conduct two concerts in Paris, one on
July 13 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, exclusively
for our soldiers and Red Cross nurses stationed in and near
Paris, and the other on the following afternoon, Sunday,
July 14 (the Fête Nationale of the French), the entire
proceeds of which were to be given to the Croix Rouge
Française. For the latter concert the French Government
immediately offered their historic <span class='it'>Salle du Conservatoire</span>, a
courtesy that had never been extended to a foreign conductor
before. This was to be a symphonic concert, entirely
devoted in honor of the day to works of the great
French composers, but at the first rehearsal it looked as if
the concert would have to be cancelled because it seemed
impossible to collect a first-class orchestra of eighty men.
The four years of war had called almost every male
citizen of France into military service, and the recent
evacuation of Paris had drawn with it many of the musicians
who had until then remained in the city. At my
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
first rehearsal only forty-three men appeared, and these
were divided in most abnormal fashion. There were five
first violins, ten seconds, two violas, one violoncello, and
three double-basses. There was no oboe or English horn;
only two French horns, one trumpet, etc. Of the forty-three
men assembled seven were members of the <span class='it'>Garde
Républicaine</span>, the famous Paris military band, but which
unfortunately for me had to attend an official celebration
of the Fête Nationale at the Trocadéro on the Sunday
afternoon. The President of the republic was to be present
with various other dignitaries and a chorus of three
thousand school-children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was in despair, and finally made an appeal to the orchestra
in very voluble but ungrammatical French, the
gist of which was that America had gladly sent one million
soldiers to France and was getting ready to send two
millions more; all I asked in return was an orchestra of
eighty men! Could they not help me to supplement
their thin ranks with a sufficient number of trained musicians
to complete the orchestra? My little speech was
received with an agitated enthusiasm. They immediately
began to gather in excited groups and swore to me that the
orchestra could and would be obtained. One assured me
of a fine oboe, another of a trumpeter, another of a first
violin, and so on. M. Cortot also got busy. He sent for
Captain Ballay, the conductor of the <span class='it'>Garde Républicaine</span>,
and represented to him in what seemed to me an eloquent
oration worthy of the <span class='it'>Chambre des Députés</span>, that after
Seicheprey and Château-Thierry France could not and
would not refuse an American anything he asked for.
Captain Ballay enthusiastically agreed, and promised to
send the seven members of his band whom I needed for
my concert—in the swiftest taxi-cabs he could procure—from
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
the Trocadéro, where the governmental celebration
was to begin at three o’clock, immediately after they had
played his opening overture, to the <span class='it'>Salle du Conservatoire</span>
at which my concert was scheduled for four. He thought
that the President of the republic was not musical enough
to notice the absence of these seven men, and that he
would manage to get along without them for the rest of
his programme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time, noted French soloists who ordinarily
did not play in orchestras, offered their services—Captain
Pollain, famous violoncellist from Nancy and
M. Hewitt (whose great-grandfather had been an American
but whose family had lived in France for three generations),
solo violinist of the Instruments Anciens.
And at the second rehearsal, whom should I see, but dear
old Longy, for thirty years celebrated oboe player of the
Boston Symphony, who said to me most touchingly: “I
see you have no second oboe. I have no instrument in
France as I left mine in Boston, but I will borrow one
and play for you if you need me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At my second rehearsal an excellent orchestra of
seventy-seven men assembled, and at the third the orchestra
was complete, including many French soldiers in
uniform, four or five distinguished virtuosi who played
in orchestra only for this occasion, and even one of my
own first violinists from the New York Symphony Orchestra,
Reber Johnson, who, having been rejected for the
army as physically not fit, had immediately volunteered
in the American Red Cross, and turned up at the rehearsal
in his uniform in the most natural way, as if this
had been one of the regular daily rehearsals of the New
York Symphony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first trumpeter was a young French soldier who
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
had played clarinet before the war. His arm had been
shot off only a year before, and as soon as he left the hospital
he studied the trumpet and with his one arm not
only held but fingered it with remarkable facility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think that in all my long career I have ever
conducted concerts or rehearsals in which both conductor
and players were enveloped in such an atmosphere of
emotional excitement. Our young, handsome boys in
khaki seemed like demigods to these tired and worn people
who had fought with such incredible tenacity for four
terrible years. The members of the orchestra received
every criticism which I made during the rehearsals with
a quick nod or an engaging smile, and every now and then
some remark of mine regarding the proper interpretation
would be followed by a murmur of approval, which would
spread through the orchestra and sometimes even vent
itself in applause. I hope that my criticisms, as well as
my interpretations, pleased them, but I know that even
if they had not, it would have made no difference. I was
an American and that was enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Saturday-night concert, which was more popular
in character, I gave our American soldier audience
Victor Herbert’s clever medley on American airs, and
those Frenchmen played as if they had known them all
their lives. The huge audience in khaki fairly seethed
with patriotic excitement, which of course found its climax
when we turned into “Dixie.” All jumped to their
feet and cheered and cheered, so that for ten bars or so
literally nothing of the music could be heard, and only
by the waving of my stick and the motions of the players
could one tell that the music was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following afternoon the programme was one of real
symphonic proportions, and included Saint-Saëns’s great
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
“Symphony No. 3” for orchestra, organ, and piano, Debussy’s
“L’Après-midi d’un Faune,” and the “Symphonic
Variations” for piano with orchestra, by César Franck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organ part in the symphony was played by Mlle.
Nadia Boulanger, without doubt the greatest woman musician
I have ever known, and the Franck “Variations”
were superbly interpreted by Alfred Cortot. M. Casadesus
played an exquisite concerto for the viola d’amour
by Laurenziti.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little <span class='it'>Salle du Conservatoire</span>, its quaint architecture
dating from the time of Louis XVI, with its tiny boxes
and balconies, was jammed to the doors—the janitor told
me that it was the largest audience he had ever seen
there. Every available space was filled twice over and
the walls literally bulged outward. The audience was a
very interesting one. The French Government, with its
usual politeness, had sent official representatives from the
<span class='it'>Ministère des Etrangères</span>, the <span class='it'>Ministère des Beaux Arts</span>,
and the French High Commission—many of them in uniform.
There were also many French musicians of distinction,
among them dear Maître Charles Widor, the
<span class='it'>Secrétaire Perpétuel de l’Institut de France</span>, and, of course,
many French, British, and American soldiers. A New
York fire commissioner would have gasped at the way in
which all precautions were disregarded, and the excitement
in the audience, when at the end of the concert we
played the “Marseillaise” and the “Star-Spangled Banner,”
can be imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To add to my pleasure my daughter Alice, who was
doing war work away down in Brest, had received permission
to come up to Paris for the great occasion. My
old friend, Paul Cravath, vice-president of the New York
Symphony Society, who was at that time at the head of
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
our Finance Commission in London, had flown over in
an English airplane, and smiled upon me from a centre
box in all his splendor of six feet four as I turned around to
make my bow to the cheering audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think we gave them an exceedingly good concert.
The orchestra were delightful in their keen desire to carry
out my intentions; but I think if we had played less well
the enthusiasm would have been just as great, for while
we were playing, the names of Seicheprey and Château-Thierry
were vibrating in the hearts of all listeners, and
their enthusiasm was poured out upon me as if I, single-handed,
demonstrated the valor of our American troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the concert, the president of the Musical
Orchestral Union of Paris presented me with a large
bouquet of roses tied with the American colors, and in a
very eloquent speech voiced the gratitude of the French
musicians for the assistance which had been given them
by our Society of American Friends of Musicians in
France. I was able to supplement my words of thanks
with a further substantial check, which had been sent by
Mr. Flagler and which was to be devoted to the families
of orchestral musicians serving at the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week had been fully occupied with the preparations
for these two concerts, but notwithstanding the attendant
excitements and elations I had periods of great
despondency. The possibility of continuing my mission
in France seemed less and less capable of fulfilment,
partly owing to the tense military situation and partly
because I did not seem to get the proper assistance from
the Y. M. C. A. Mr. McLane and Mr. Sloane, at the
head of affairs in New York, had given me their enthusiastic
support, and I had sailed at their urgent request.
They had cabled and written full instructions to the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
“Y” in France, and on my arrival Mr. Ernest Carter,
the head worker, whom I liked exceedingly, had promised
me the fullest co-operation. But he was evidently
harassed and overworked and did not get the efficient
help which he should have had in the running of so large
an organization in war time. Many of the heads of departments
were ex-clergymen or church and Sunday-school
workers who were evidently inexperienced in the
management of practical affairs. I am told that later on
this condition was much improved and that the men who
were subsequently sent out from America were chosen
more for their business ability, but at the time I mention,
the confusion at the headquarters in the Rue d’Agesseau
was often great and there seemed to be insufficient
co-operation between the different departments. In order
to be able to travel around France unmolested I had
to have a <span class='it'>carte rouge</span>, and this card it seemed impossible
to obtain for me, notwithstanding all my proper and
complete credentials as an American, as a musician well
known all over our country, and, above all, as a <span class='it'>persona
grata</span> with the French Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days before my first concert I was informed that
it was impossible to procure this card for me, and that
therefore I could not be permitted to leave Paris. When
I asked for an explanation, it was refused by a rather
sanctimonious person who put his arm around me, called
me brother, but expressed his regret at the unfortunate
fact of my having been born in Germany. I swallowed
my rage as best I could, but my chagrin was all the greater
because in the meantime M. Casadesus and four other
distinguished French artists had offered me their services
to travel around with me in a motor-car and give
concerts in our camps and hospitals. I finally obtained
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
the information from a very nice young man who was in
charge of the entertainment division of the “Y” that he
understood that the objections came from the Intelligence
Department of the A. E. F. I immediately called on
Major Cabot Ward, the head of the Intelligence Division
in Paris whom I had known in New York for twenty-five
years. I showed him my various credentials, and he assured
me that: “As far as the United States army is concerned,
you are as free as air.” I returned with this information
to the Rue d’Agesseau and was met by the
same impenetrable wall of ignorance or ill-will; and, as my
friends at the French High Commission had already assured
me that as far as they were concerned all France
was open to me, I seemed to be at my wit’s end how to
unravel this riddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I finally called on my friend, Robert Bliss, counsellor
of our embassy in Paris. I can never forget his kindness
and helpfulness during this period. He and his charming
wife had made their apartment the very centre of American
life during those trying times. Mrs. Bliss had resolutely
refused to leave Paris, and dispensed a generous
hospitality at their apartment in the Rue Henri Moissan.
When I told him of my troubles and that I, who had lived
in America forty-seven years, should now be thus treated,
he smiled and said: “We can do nothing for you at present,
as you are still a part of the organization of the Y. M.
C. A., but as soon as you get that uniform off, you will
find every road open to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That wretched uniform! It had annoyed me from the
first moment I had put it on because the tailor to whom
the “Y” had sent me had made a miserable job of it. It
was too narrow between the shoulders, which is fatal for
an orchestral conductor, and the trousers were a tragedy.
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
But there was no time before sailing to order a better-fitting
uniform, and as I had been told that I could not
move an inch in France without it I had literally taken no
civilian clothes with me! I had ordered some new clothes
in Paris, but there was a tailors’ strike on and I was therefore,
for decency’s sake, compelled to hold on to that
uniform, much as I longed to divest myself of the symbol
of the sacred triangle. However, I began to see daylight,
and as I hoped by the following Monday or Tuesday to
get my new civilian clothes, I decided to conduct the two
concerts on Saturday and Sunday and then magnificently
hand in my resignation. But I was not spared a last drop
of bitterness, for on Saturday morning I received a visit
from a very stupid and exasperating <span class='it'>officier de liaison</span> of
the Y. M. C. A., who proceeded to inform me that as I
had been “born in Germany” and therefore could not obtain
my <span class='it'>carte rouge</span>, the committee of the “Y” thought
that I should not conduct the two concerts in their uniform.
Again that accursed uniform! I was so enraged
that I said I would either conduct in it or in my underclothes,
that my resignation had already been written
and would be presented on Monday, and that I insisted
on an interview with Mr. Carter and his executive committee,
as I wished them to know how I had been treated.
I knew that Mr. Carter, poor man, had no knowledge of
the entire affair, as he had been zigzagging around France
all this time to the various posts and supply centres of the
“Y,” trying to bring some kind of order out of chaos.
He immediately accorded me a meeting, and when I told
my story, made me an apology so ample and generous
that I left him with none but the kindliest feelings and
really regretted that he, a man of high ideals and spiritual
power, should through the exigencies of war have been
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
so overburdened with practical affairs. For a few of his
aides I have nothing but absolute contempt, but there were
many among the men workers and certainly the majority
of the women who gave wonderful service and gladly suffered
all kinds of annoyances and deprivations in order
to help the soldiers, who were not all angels by any
means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my real triumph was to come on the very Sunday
morning of my concert when General Charles Dawes, of
the American army, called on me at my hotel and, to my
amazement, asked me whether I could come to the general
headquarters of the A. E. F. at Chaumont, and confer
with General Pershing regarding the possible improvement
of our army bands. I could not believe my ears that
so suddenly after my bitter experiences with the “Y,”
the commander-in-chief of the American army in France
had personally sent for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Dawes was at that time at the head of the
army supplies, with headquarters in Paris. A great lover
of music, he had contributed largely to its cultivation in
his own city of Chicago. He was an old and valued friend
of General Pershing and I think that it was he who had
suggested my name to him. I can never thank General
Dawes enough for giving me, a musician and over fifty
years of age, this wonderful opportunity to touch even
the outer hem of the robes of the war goddess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Needless to say, my despondent mood immediately
changed to one of elation. I accepted the invitation
with alacrity and arranged with General Dawes to go to
Chaumont on the following Wednesday, July 17.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the air had been full of rumors regarding
the “Big Bertha” who had been conveniently silent
ever since my arrival in Paris. It was persistently said
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
that on Monday morning seventeen of these ladies bearing
the same name would again begin a bombardment of
Paris, and I confess that it gave me something of a shock,
when, on the Monday morning after my concert while I
was still luxuriating in bed—thinking with pleasure of the
triumphs of the day before and with eager anticipation
of my approaching trip to Chaumont—I suddenly heard
a curious reverberation, different from the explosions of
the Gothas or of the answering air-guns. It was the first
greeting of Madame Bertha, and this greeting was repeated
punctiliously every fifteen minutes throughout
the day, the shells striking in Paris in different quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was interesting to watch the French people. After
every shot, crowds of them would run into the streets,
talking, gesticulating, and speculating where that particular
shell had fallen. This would go on for thirteen or
fourteen minutes and then all would scoot back into their
shops and houses as they knew that the next shell was
about due.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening I had been invited to dine at Mrs. Edith
Wharton’s, at her lovely apartment in the Rue de Varennes.
Just as I got to her door a Frenchman stopped
and said to me that he had been at the concert on the
preceding day. He then added: “I see that you are making
the acquaintance of ‘La Grosse Berthe.’ ” Thinking
that he referred to the return of the bombardment, I
smiled assent, and then proceeded to Mrs. Wharton’s
apartment. I found our great novelist with two other
ladies, an American officer, and an American composer, my
dear friend Blair Fairchild, who had been living in Paris
for several years and was acting most ably as distributing
agent for the money which our “Society of American
Friends of Musicians in France” was sending over. The
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
dinner proceeded as if we lived in times of deepest peace.
It was served with punctilious efficiency, the flowers were
charming, and the conversation delightful, and it was
only when dinner was half over that I found out, quite
casually, that what my French gentleman at the door
had referred to was, that only two minutes before my arrival
the last shell of the Big Bertha had fallen on the
roof of the house opposite, demolishing it and parts of
the upper story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following Wednesday, July 17, I took the morning
train for Chaumont, again comfortably clad in civilian
clothes. I was met at the station by a young officer,
Lieutenant Wendell, nephew of my old friend Evart
Wendell, who took me to general headquarters and introduced
me to Lieutenant-Colonel Collins, secretary of
the General Staff, who explained to me in detail various
points on which General Pershing desired information
and assistance. I was then most comfortably put up at
the guest-house, formerly a large private residence in the
town, which had been taken over by General Pershing to
accommodate his visitors. I was to dine at his château
that evening, and spent a great part of the afternoon
walking through the quaint old hill town situated on a
high cliff overlooking the valley of the Marne. It was
during this walk that I saw the only drunken American
private during my three months’ stay in France. I was
following a picturesque road leading out of the town into
the country, when a colored boy in khaki reeled toward
me and said: “ ’Scuse me, sah. Are you a Frenchman?”
I said “No,” and he replied: “Then foh Gawd sake, will
you please tell me whar ah can get a drink?” I answered:
“No. You have evidently had enough already.” He
tried to follow me and I, seeing two white soldiers approaching,
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
turned to them, and said: “I think you had
better take care of this boy. He has had too much to
drink.” They briskly answered: “Certainly, sir.” But
as they went up to him he kept peering at me and said:
“I want to talk to that gen’leman. That’s Mr. Damrosch!”
I laughed out loud, for here I was, over three
thousand miles from home, and this boy, who perhaps
had musical inclinations and had heard me conduct in
some concert, recognized me even through the alcoholic
vapors which surrounded him so thickly that one could
have cut them with a knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the other visitors at the guest-house was General
Omar Bundy, who commanded the first division and
had come to Chaumont to receive the congratulations
of the commander-in-chief on the splendid work of his
division. He proved a delightful gentleman, and we
chatted together very amicably as a motor-car took us
that evening about five miles beyond Chaumont through
most lovely country to the château surrounded by exquisite
gardens and woods which General Pershing had
taken for his personal residence. A scene of greater
peace and tranquillity could not be imagined, and literally
the only sign and symbol of war was the solitary
sentry pacing up and down before the entrance, with
bayonet fixed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this happened to be the first day of General Foch’s
great attack in which he pushed the Germans back six
miles, General Pershing, who had been at the front all
day, had not yet returned, and General Bundy and I
walked through the grounds in the lovely evening twilight
for perhaps half an hour, when a motor-car drove
up and our great commander-in-chief, accompanied by
his aide, immediately came over to us and made us welcome
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
in hearty and simple fashion. He reminded me
that we had met at the Presidio in San Francisco during
the great exhibition of 1915, and indeed I remembered it
well, for shortly afterward he had been sent to the
Mexican border in command of the troops, and while
there had been overwhelmed by the terrible tragedy of
the death of his wife and children, who were suffocated
in a fire at night which destroyed their home at the
Presidio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much has been written regarding the wonderful
impression which General Pershing made in Europe on
all who came in contact with him that it is not necessary
for me to more than echo the general chorus of praise—soldierly,
dignified, courteous, and simple in his bearing,
wearing a uniform as only a man can who has been a
soldier all his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the house and shortly after sat down to
dinner. The party consisted of the commander-in-chief,
General Bundy, and a most delightful staff of eight officers—I
being the only civilian. As such I expected and
half hoped that the talk would be all about the wonderful
success of the first day’s push by Foch, of which I had
already heard enthusiastic rumors in the town, or of
great military secrets, affairs of strategy, monster guns,
thousands of airplanes, and new, mysterious machines of
destruction. But, to my surprise, the conversation during
almost the entire dinner was of music, of its influence
in raising the spirits of the soldier, in giving him the right
kind of recreation and the necessary relief from the
monotony of camp work or the horrors of battle. General
Pershing told me that after hearing some of the crack
military bands of France and England he had been so
overwhelmed by the consciousness of our inferiority that
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
he was eager to know if something could not be done to
improve the general standard of our army bands, and,
more particularly, whether it might not be possible at
least to take out the best players from among the bands
then in France and to form a headquarters band of
superior excellence, led by the best bandmaster among
them, and in this way form a model which the others
could endeavor to copy. This suggestion seemed to me
excellent, and I asked how many bandmasters there were
at present in France, as I would like to examine them as
to their fitness. General Pershing said, with a smile,
that there were over two hundred, but this did not phase
me and I agreed to examine them all, provided that proper
arrangements could be made for a fitting test of their
qualifications. Various plans for such an examination
were discussed and General Pershing finally decided to
send them all to Paris in batches of fifty every week, together
with a military band which should be stationed
there for the following four or five weeks, thus giving me
abundant opportunity to test their efficiency in conducting
as well as in harmony and orchestration. It seemed
to me at the time remarkable that, in the midst of war
and with all its many immediate necessities weighing
upon him, General Pershing should have had the acumen
to perceive the value of music in war time and to interest
himself in its improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I sat there, the memory of the hollow-cheeked Bandmaster
Tyler who had stood next to me at the Fourth of
July parade in Paris suddenly came back. I thought to
myself that here I was, the only civilian at the table, and
that therefore I might say anything I pleased without
being put up against a wall at sunrise and shot, for at
the worst they could only consider me as very ignorant
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
of army customs. Therefore I watched for my opportunity
and suddenly plunged in and spoke of my conversation
with Bandmaster Tyler while we were waiting for our
marines to march down the Champs-Élysées. I said that
in my humble opinion it was a great mistake to use musicians
as stretcher-bearers in battle, not that their lives
as soldiers were any more valuable than those of any
others in the army, but that a stretcher-bearer could be
trained in a very short time while it took many months
to train a bandsman; that the Canadian regiments had
followed the same custom during the first months of the
war, but the results had been so dire in destroying the
bands and their usefulness, that the soldiers themselves
had implored their commanding officers not to let their
bandsmen be sacrificed in this way, as there was nothing
so terrible as coming back after battle to a silent and
therefore desolate camp. After I had finished my rather
impassioned peroration, General Bundy and others heartily
agreed with me, but General Pershing said nothing
at all, and I felt that I had perhaps talked too much and
<span class='it'>mal à propos</span>. But the following morning, as I was seated
with Colonel Collins at general headquarters arranging
the details of my examinations, he smilingly handed me
an order from the commander-in-chief which had just
arrived and which was to be sent to the division commanders,
to the effect that “from now on bandsmen are
not to be used any longer as stretcher-bearers except in
cases of extreme military urgency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of General Pershing’s remarks during the dinner is
so characteristic that I repeat it here. He said: “When
peace is declared and our bands march up Fifth Avenue
I should like them to play so well that it will be another
proof of the advantage of military training.” Subsequent
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
developments and meetings with this interesting
man further deepened the impression which he made
upon me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I returned to Paris and proceeded to make all necessary
arrangements for the examinations of the two hundred
bandmasters. Our army had leased a large hotel near
the Bastille on the banks of the Seine, and a large room
on the ground floor served admirably for my purpose.
The band of the 329th infantry soon arrived and was
quartered in this hotel, and every morning at 9.30 the
examinations began and continued from Monday to
Thursday at the rate of about fifty bandmasters a week,
who arrived from all quarters of France—from the seaport
towns, from the training camps, and some even from
the very front line of the trenches. Fridays I would
usually return to headquarters and report on my findings
and begin recommendations, which gradually assumed
greater and greater proportions as the magnitude of the
work developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To assist me in this prodigious work, I engaged the
services of M. Francis Casadesus, brother of Henri and
a splendid musician. He examined the men as to their
qualifications in instrumentation and in their general
knowledge of the various instruments, while I examined
them in the actual process of conducting and drilling a
band. I would first let them bite their teeth into an overture
like the “Oberon” of Weber, or a movement from a
classical symphony, and then would let them conduct a
composition of their own choice. I found very soon that
while most of these young bandmasters were musically
talented and ambitious, they had had no or but little
opportunity for acquiring what we may call the technic
of the baton. They had had no intensive disciplinary
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
training such as our young officers from civilian life had
received at Plattsburg and similar camps. Many of
them did not know how to beat time properly, much less
train a band in phrasing or rhythmic accuracy; and I soon
saw that unless some opportunity was given them to
learn at least the rudiments of their calling, the effort
toward improving our bands would be useless. It therefore
seemed to me that the quick formation of a bandmasters’
school was the only solution of the problem, and
as our army had had the help of French military and
aviation officers as instructors, loaned to us by the
<span class='it'>Ministère de la Guerre</span>, I thought that a similar arrangement
could be made, under which we might obtain the
necessary musical instructors also from the French army,
as nearly all the musicians of France were at that time
in uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also discovered that some of the most important
musical instruments which give mellowness and nobility
to the tone of a band were almost utterly lacking. We
had hardly any oboes, bassoons, French horns, or flügelhorns.
I knew that some of the greatest masters of these
instruments, first prizes of the Conservatoire of Paris,
were serving in the French army, and immediately,
through the <span class='it'>Ministère des Beaux Arts</span>, obtained their
names and the regiments to which they belonged. On
the following visit to Chaumont I proposed to General
Pershing that we form a music-school at which fifty bandmasters
could get the most intensive musical training
and discipline for eight weeks, to be succeeded by a new
batch of fifty, etc., and at the same time forty pupils each
in oboe, bassoon, French horn, and flügelhorn could get
a similar training of twelve weeks on their respective instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
General Pershing and his staff were delighted with the
plan and I offered to procure the necessary instructors
from the French army, promising General Pershing that
the school would be in complete running order by October
1, provided a proper building could be obtained. The
general asked me where I wished to place the school and
offered me Longres, where several schools on the strategy
of war were already in progress, but I claimed that the
surroundings for my music-school should be of a more
“peaceful and even academic character,” and suggested
Chaumont. General Pershing smiled, but insisted that it
was already overcrowded and that I would not be able to
find a building large enough to house so great a number
of instructors and pupils. He gave me full power, however,
to see what could be done, and I set forth immediately
with a French liaison officer—member of the French
Military Commission at Chaumont, and in G-5, general
headquarters, under which department the proposed
music-school would come—who proved a most remarkable
and valuable assistant in my work. He was Lieutenant
Michel Weill, nephew of the owner of the well-known
White House in San Francisco, and an enthusiastic
musical amateur who, through his long residence in
America, had acquired a knowledge of English and a
sympathy for America only second to that for his own
native land. He belonged to a delightful French officers’
mess at Chaumont, and they immediately made me a
kind of honorary member and in most hospitable fashion
invited me to their Lucullan repasts. As they were all
enthusiastic lovers of music, I endeavored to repay them
by pounding out Wagner, their supreme favorite, to their
hearts’ content on an old upright piano placed in a little
sitting-room next to their <span class='it'>salle à manger</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
Lieutenant Weill and I first paid a <span class='it'>visite de cérémonie</span>
to the <span class='it'>Maire</span> of Chaumont and explained to him our desire.
The idea of what he called “<span class='it'>un petit conservatoire
de musique pour les Américains</span>” in Chaumont appealed
to his fancy immensely, and he immediately picked up
his telephone and called up an old friend of his, a fellow
citizen and mill owner. He explained to him the great
honor that was about to befall their town if a proper building
could be found, and exhorted him to show himself as
a really patriotic citizen of France and friend of the
Americans by giving the mill which he owned just outside
the city and only a few minutes’ walk from our
headquarters for this noble purpose. We motored to
this building and met there an elderly, dignified, and
courteous Frenchman who told us that anything he had
was at the disposal of “les Américains.” We found a
huge mill with walls two feet thick, the machinery in
disuse, and with large empty spaces that our army engineers
could easily turn into sleeping-quarters, practising-rooms,
and other needs for a music-school. In one
large wing we found a few women and many children
playing about. I said: “Of course, we shall need this
wing also.” “Then I regret,” answered the owner,
“but this wing you cannot have, because I have given it
to forty-eight refugees from Verdun with the promise
that they shall occupy it until the end of the war.” Naturally
Lieutenant Weill and I reconsidered, and concluded
that a large tent could be put up in the meadow as
an eating-place, and that we could get along without the
extra wing. I then asked the owner what rental he
would demand. “Oh,” he said, “anything that the
American army wishes to pay.” But when Lieutenant
Weill informed him that he should fix a fair price, he
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
asked timidly: “Would the American army consider five
hundred francs a month reasonable?” I tell this to offset
the tales of those people who keep harping on the commercial
greed of the French in anything that concerned
the needs of the American soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We returned to general headquarters jubilant, and, after
a satisfactory interview with the officer in charge of
building operations, it was decided to place the school in
Chaumont, and I returned to Paris to complete my plans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My brother Frank had recognized the lack of good
schooling for our army bands and bandmasters many
years before the war, and had very patriotically placed
the entire machinery of his Institute of Musical Art at
the disposal of the secretary of war. An arrangement had
accordingly been made by which a bandmaster’s school
at Governor’s Island, New York, was placed under my
brother’s control, and for several years before the war a
small number of bandmasters were graduated from it
who ranked well on a par with those of other countries.
But when we entered the war and our army was organized
on a scale of millions these were but a drop in the
bucket, and heroic measures were necessary to bring some
semblance of order into this musical chaos of hundreds of
uneducated bandmasters and thousands of still less educated
bandsmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these five weeks in Paris and Chaumont I
worked very hard and, while my life has been crowded
with affairs of all kinds relating to my profession, I cannot
recall any time when the work was so constant day
and night or when I was more jubilantly happy in the
doing of it. During the forenoons Casadesus and I would
examine the bandmasters, discover what they could and
could not do, give them, so to speak, “first aid to the
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
wounded” by pointing out their worst failings or their
greatest weaknesses. In the afternoons Lieutenant Weill
and I would run around to the various French government
departments on the track of this or that musician whom
we wished to corral as professor for our school. At night
I would sit propped up in bed and work out the entire
tuition plan of the school, down to the minutest details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My general recommendations to general headquarters,
all of which were subsequently carried out, included
classes for the bandmasters’ instruction in the technic
of conducting, in harmony, and in orchestration. These
classes were put in charge of M. Francis Casadesus and
M. André Caplet. The latter was later on succeeded by
Lieutenant Albert Stoessel, a highly talented bandmaster
in our army, who has returned to civilian life and has
now become my successor as conductor of the New York
Oratorio Society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Ellacott, of the A. E. F., became the military
head of the school to which he gave most sympathetic
assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two professors each for oboe, bassoon,
French horn, and flügelhorn, all of whom were graduates
and first prizes of the famous Paris Conservatoire. I
also recommended that the beautiful B-flat bugles of
the French army be adopted by us and that a French
drum-major, proficient on this instrument, be appointed
as instructor to drill successive classes of fifty for one
month each, the graduates to become first buglers of our
regiments, in order that they might, in turn, instruct other
buglers in their respective drum and bugle corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the examinations I also asked the bandmasters certain
questions regarding their position in their respective
regiments, the attitude of their colonel toward music,
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
their general treatment, and the hours allowed them for
musical practice, and here I came on all kinds of conditions.
Some of the commanding officers had no sympathy
with music or with the bandsmen, and instead of
making them practise their six hours a day, they were
put to work as kitchen police and on other fatigue duties.
I therefore urged that the commanding officers be impressed
with the fact that the primary object of the band
is not to fight, but to cheer the fighters, and the better
their music, the greater its beneficial effects upon the
spirit of the soldiers, and that therefore all bandsmen
should be compelled to devote at least five or six hours
every day to the practice of their instruments and to
rehearsals, and that other duties should be made subsidiary
to their musical work and should not be of a
character to unfit them for a proper performance on their
respective instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also discovered that there was a terrible wastage as
regards musical instruments and that in several instances,
preparatory to going into action, the instruments had been
thrown away or simply left behind, nevermore to be recovered,
and that therefore it might be wise to appoint
a travelling inspector of musical instruments whose duties
should be to attend to the speedy replacement of missing
parts, the repairing of instruments, and the supplying
of new music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A really excellent headquarters band was formed at
Chaumont, which became a source of much gratification
to the commander-in-chief and his staff, accompanying
him on many of his ceremonial visits and functions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of my most important recommendations for the
school was that every week at least one concert should be
given by the professors and such of the bandsmen as were
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
really competent musicians. The programmes should be
made up only of the great master composers, in order that
the students—many of whom had come from isolated
communities in our country and had had but little opportunity
to hear good music—should become sensitive to
the finer and more spiritual qualities of music as an art.
This was carried out in most remarkable fashion during
the entire existence of the school, and the programmes
and their performance were worthy of a place in any
highly cultivated musical community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I returned to Chaumont on a visit of inspection
the following year, I heard one of these concerts, which
included a quintet of Mozart for oboe and strings and a
sonata for violin and piano by César Franck. I sat in
delighted amazement as I saw the happy faces of over a
hundred students in khaki who were listening to this
divine music in rapt silence. What a pity that such a
school cannot be founded in every State in America now
that the war is over and our soldiers have returned home!
This would speedily result in an excellent band for every
town and lay a real foundation for the musical development
of the people at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During these weeks in Paris I also saw a great deal of
some of my French musician colleagues, all of whom had
refused to leave Paris in spite of the Gothas and Berthas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first called on Charles Marie Widor, the famous
old organist of Saint Sulpice, I found him installed, by
virtue of his office as <span class='it'>Secrétaire Perpétuel</span> of the <span class='it'>Institut
de France</span>, in a charming Louis XVI suite of rooms in
that building. He showed me a hole in the window of
his workroom and told me that a few days before he had
just stooped down to pick up a musical score from the
floor when a shell from the Big Bertha burst in front of
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
his apartment and a piece of it hurtled through his window,
missing him only because he was in a stooping position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His Gallic wit and versatility make him a delightful
companion, and I am grateful for the opportunity the
war gave me for more intimate acquaintance and friendship
with him. Indeed, this applies to all the friends
made during that eventful summer. The war brought
us more quickly and closely together than would have
been possible otherwise, and as I was an American I
reaped the full advantage of all the intense gratitude
which the French felt for us, some of which was hardly
deserved, as our government certainly had shilly-shallied
and waited until it was almost too late before they threw
our great weight of men and treasure into the balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already spoken of Mlle. Nadia Boulanger, who
played the organ for me at the performance of Saint-Saëns’s
“Third Symphony” on July 14. Among women
I have never met her equal in musicianship, and indeed
there are very few men who can compare with her. She
is one of the finest organists of France, an excellent pianist,
and the best reader of orchestral scores that I have
ever known. Again and again I have seen her take up a
manuscript orchestral score, sit down with it at the piano,
and brilliantly read it at sight, transcribing it for the
piano as she played along. When we first met, she and
her dear mother were in the greatest grief. A younger
sister, Lili, had died only a month before at twenty-four
years of age. Beautiful, exquisite, and marvellously talented,
she had won the much-coveted <span class='it'>Prix de Rome</span>
three years before—the first woman to have gained it.
A mortal illness had slowly sapped her strength, and as
she had been the idol of her mother and sister, her loss
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
was to them a tragedy almost beyond endurance. Nadia,
besides keeping up her professional duties—she was substitute
organist at the Madeleine during the war—hurled
herself into war work and more especially the care of the
students of the Conservatoire who were at the front. She
knew all their names and the numbers of their organizations
and founded a kind of musical gazette, mimeographed
copies of which were sent out every month to the
students. All kinds of musical news and musical questions
were published in it, so that these boys, in the midst
of their military duties or while convalescing from their
wounds in the hospitals, could have something to think
about more immediately connected with their own profession.
It is interesting to note that, in answer to the
question, “Should German composers like Brahms and
Wagner be played at our concerts during the war?” out
of fifty-eight, forty-seven answered unequivocally “Yes”
for Wagner and Brahms, three “Yes” for Beethoven and
the classics, two were undecided, and six said “No.”
These answers were accompanied in many cases by
highly interesting essays on art and nationality of art,
and, altogether, the judgments thus expressed reflected
the high intellectual standard of these young French artists
at the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw many instances of how keenly the French separate
their artistic from their political convictions. One
night my friends of the French Military Commission at
Chaumont had come to Paris and one of them, Captain
Guegnier, invited me to dinner at his apartment. His
wife and the wife of one of his colleagues had come to
Paris from the country especially for the occasion. We
sat down, a very jolly party of six, to a most delicious
dinner such as only the French can devise and properly
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
execute. As all the party were musical we naturally had
a good deal of music after dinner. The ladies sang charmingly
and I had to play excerpts from their beloved Wagner—“Tristan,”
“Meistersinger,” “Parsifal,” and the
“Trilogy.” My hostess sang songs of Fauré, Chausson,
and Debussy, and just then the sirens boomed out their
disagreeable message that the Gothas were taking advantage
of the moonlit night to make one of their raids over
Paris. At the same moment the taxi-cab man, who had
come to take me back to my hotel, announced that he
had arrived. Would he like to come up-stairs? Oh,
no, he would just sit inside the cab and wait till I got
ready. “Then let us have some more music,” said my
hostess, and simply drew the curtain over the windows.
And, while the Gothas were scattering their shells over
Paris, she turned to me and said: “Now let me sing for
you this lovely song of Schubert.” There was my French
hostess singing German songs, and it was not until about
one o’clock in the morning that Lieutenant Weill and I
turned homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vast difference in attitude between the French and
certain of my compatriots regarding the proper stand to
be taken in time of war toward the art of an enemy nation
was very striking. I had myself decided that the
New York Symphony Orchestra should not play the
works of living German composers, and that the German
language should not be sung at our concerts during the
war. There seemed to me good and valid reasons for
such a course. But Beethoven, Mozart, and Wagner I
considered as classics, belonging to us just as much as to
Germany, and their divine message had naught to do
with the political and military leaders of Germany who
had plunged the world into this horrible bath of blood.
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
There was, however, in New York a small but noisy
group led by a few women who sought to demonstrate
their “patriotism” by hysterical outbursts and newspaper
protests against the performance of all music composed
by Germans, no matter how many years ago. Some of
these women, through the curious psychosis of war,
really thought that they were serving their country by
their protests. In the winter of 1918 the orchestra of the
Paris Conservatoire made a tour through America under
their conductor, André Messager. When I called on him
the day after his arrival he showed me a letter he had
just received from one of these women protesting against
his performing a Beethoven Symphony during his stay
in America. He was white with anger, and when I asked
him how he would answer it, he said: “I will answer it as
a French artist should.” I said: “The best way to answer
would be to put Beethoven’s ‘Eroica’ Symphony on your
first programme.” “I will,” he said; and he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The opposition to Wagner was based on very amusing
premises. Because some of his heroes were wont to appear
on the stage in very blond wigs and beards, these
lady sleuth-hounds seemed to perceive some evil and subtle
connection between <span class='it'>Siegfried</span> in the “Nibelungen
Trilogy” and Nietzsche’s “blond beast,” which, according
to his prophecy, was eventually to control the earth.
Their studies of Wagner were too shallow to enable them
to realize that the whole philosophy of life as expressed
by Wagner in the “Nibelungen Trilogy” was in direct
contrast to the desire of the modern militaristic German
to rule and control the world by force. Wagner depicts
a prehistoric world in which the gods of greed, lust, and
power rule, carrying, however, the seed of their own destruction
within them because of the materialistic quality
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
of their desires. As their power wanes and the old
gods perish, a new religion is born, the religion of self-sacrifice
through love, as symbolized by <span class='it'>Brunhilde</span> in her
self-immolation on the funeral pyre of <span class='it'>Siegfried</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this is already ancient history, and I for one
confidently believe that the racial spirit which created
the Germany of Bach, Beethoven, Goethe, Kant, and
Wagner will soon return again to brighten and ennoble
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In five weeks all necessary arrangements for the school
were completed and notices were sent by the General
Staff to the bandmasters of the entire A. E. F. who had
not come up to the necessary qualifications during the
examination which I had given them, to report to the
Chaumont School in batches of fifty every eight weeks,
beginning on October 1, and to start their studies. Students
for oboe, bassoon, French horn, and flügelhorn
were also selected from the hundreds of applicants. At
first we had great difficulty in finding the necessary instruments
for them. France is famous for its wood-wind
instruments, but the various factories had long since
ceased operations, as all the workmen were in the army.
The ever-ready and ingenious Lieutenant Weill, however,
succeeded in scraping together enough oboes and bassoons
to start the classes, and I cannot say enough for
the willing assistance which was accorded me by every
United States army officer with whom I came in contact.
From the commander-in-chief down to Lieutenant
Kelley, who sat in the anteroom of General Dawes’s office
in the Champs-Élysées, and whose principal duty
seemed to be to ward off disagreeable or tiresome callers
who wished to rob General Dawes of his valuable time,
all made me feel as if the improvement of the army bands
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
was the one thing necessary to win the war. It was high
time for me to leave France and “get back to earth,” as
I no longer walked on anything but air and with my head
projecting far above the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my last visit to Chaumont I motored down to
Domrémy, the birthplace of Jeanne d’Arc, and found the
little village in just about the same state it must have
been when she was born in the little house next to the
church, both of which have been carefully preserved for
the worshippers of to-day. The open space in front of
her house, the trees surrounding it, and the monument
in the centre seemed to me to form a natural stage on
which a peace pageant could well be enacted, and as I
sat there and the bell began to toll from the little church
in which Jeanne had whispered her prayers, I began to
dream of a possible peace celebration in which a company
of American soldiers, a company of French soldiers, an
American and a French military band, singers from the
Opéra Comique, and a children’s chorus should take part;
the climax to be the joyous meeting of the military forces
around the monument and the awakening of Jeanne from
her sleep of centuries, opening the door of her little house
and standing there looking with astonishment at the
unwonted sight of American soldiers in khaki as brothers
of her beloved countrymen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my return to Chaumont I outlined this idea to
several officers of the Staff and of the French Commission,
who received it with enthusiasm and promised every assistance,
but, alas, nothing ever came of it. When I
returned to France the following spring the armistice
had been arranged and the Versailles Conference was
dragging its weary and dreary deliberations toward an
unsatisfactory conclusion. There did not seem to be
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
enough illusion or enthusiasm left to celebrate anything
international connected with the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my last visit to Chaumont I gave a little dinner to
Colonel Collins, secretary of the Staff, whose constant
interest had been invaluable and whose mind seemed to
be capable at a moment’s notice of turning from the consideration
of some intricate military problem to the great
advantages to be derived from the introduction of the
French B-flat bugle into our army. Over a very good
magnum of champagne I rose and made him, Colonel
Boyd, and Lieutenant Weill solemnly swear that for the
rest of the war and as long thereafter as necessary the
bandmaster’s school at Chaumont should be to them as
the apple of their eye, and this oath they faithfully kept.
The school flourished from October, 1918, until June,
1919, when it was discontinued owing to the return of our
army to America. The relations between the French
professors and our boys, all living together like a happy
family, became so sympathetic and intimate that the
results may truly be said to have been remarkable. The
soldiers realized that they were receiving an education in
music equal to that of the foremost schools of France or
America, and the French professors entered into their
duties with an enthusiasm which was touching. Casadesus
told me that many of his pupils worked at their
musical problems twelve hours a day and I urged him,
in some way or other, to continue these pleasant and important
international musical relations by founding a
summer school somewhere in France, preferably near
Paris, to which American men and women, already sufficiently
advanced in their study of music, could repair
for three months every summer in order to acquaint
themselves with French art and French methods of
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
teaching. Until the war began, hundreds of American
students had gone to Germany every year, and it seemed
a pity that, owing to the Frenchman’s lack of propaganda
for what his country could offer to our students, some of
this stream could not be diverted to France. Our talks
eventually led to the founding of the <span class='it'>Conservatoire Américain</span>
at Fontainebleau, of which details are told in
another chapter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the courtesy of General Pershing I received permission
to leave for home on the army transport <span class='it'>America</span>.
This ship sailed from Brest, and I was anxious to go there
in order to see my daughter, Alice Pennington, once more.
She and her friend, Miss Letty McKim, had been there
for a year and had founded the naval Y. M. C. A., to the
great satisfaction of Admiral Wilson and our navy
stationed there. My daughter’s enthusiasm and vitality,
together with that of her equally able friend, had created
an atmosphere which our sailors greatly relished, and I
was keen to see some of her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My train was to leave Paris in the evening, and my faithful
friend and companion of the last five weeks, Lieutenant
Weill, came to the station to bid me good-by. There
were no regular sleeping-cars on this train but only what
the French call “couchettes”—four bunks in each compartment,
two on each side. The names of the occupants
were carefully written on a slip of paper and pasted on
the outside of each door, and Lieutenant Weill informed
me that a French general occupied the lower bunk opposite
mine. Sure enough, a handsome, youngish-looking
general presently appeared and, politely touching
his cap, entered our compartment and seated himself in
his bunk. Weill, in French fashion, kissed me good-by
on both cheeks, and as I had still ten minutes to spare, I
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
stood outside and saw an American naval commander
coming toward me with rather unsteady steps. He told
me that he had had thirty-six hours’ leave and that he and
his two aides had decided to spend it by going to Paris. As
the train took twelve hours each way this gave them only
twelve hours in the city of delights and he had evidently
taken full advantage of every minute of it. He told me
that his two aides had not yet turned up, that they had
all the tickets and all his money; he also confided to me
that one of them was so rich that he could have bought
the entire train. I finally found his name on the list of
our coupé, his bunk being directly over the French
general’s, and as it was getting late, I advised him to
enter. Just at that moment two handsome young naval
lieutenants rushed up, and he received them with enthusiasm,
for they had his railroad tickets. I helped him
into our compartment, where he presently sat down right
next to the general, who wrapped his cloak about him
and cuddled up into his own corner. I said to my compatriot:
“I think you are in the French general’s bunk.
Yours is the one above.” Whereupon he said: “The
French general can go to hell!” I was frightened out of
my wits, as I expected an immediate international encounter
which might have the most serious consequences.
Luckily the general understood no English, and I finally
induced my new naval friend to climb up into his own
bunk, but I made a solemn vow that I would never again
try to interfere where the army and navy of two different
countries were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned into my own bunk and slept well until next
morning, when I found the commander also awake and
possessed of a thirst which knew no bounds. There was,
of course, no drinking-water on the train, but I rushed
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
him to the restaurant of the next station where we
stopped, and he seized a carafe of water and put it to his
lips with such avidity that you could almost hear the
water sizzle as it passed down his throat. He turned out
to be a delightful fellow. He was commander of a destroyer
and had spent dreary and terrible weeks in his
little craft watching for submarines. The monotony and
discomfort of such a life cannot be imagined, as these
ships are so small that their motion is incessant and they
have to go out in the dirtiest of weather. There is hardly
ever a chance to cook meals, and those on board must eat
what and how they can. For weeks and weeks nothing
happens, but my commander had had the good luck on
his last trip to get a sub, and had received his thirty-six
hours’ leave in consequence. Small wonder that he and his
colleagues sought some relief in honor of the great event!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the next station my French general and I got a cup
of coffee. Sugar was at that time taboo, and as, thanks
to my army friends, I had my pockets full of this precious
stuff, I offered him some in place of the awful saccharine,
which he accepted gratefully and then told me that he was
going on his first vacation in two years to spend with his
family in a little watering resort this side of Brest. Sure
enough at the next station, as he got out, a charming boy
and girl, browned by the sun, rushed up to him and fairly
smothered him with kisses. It looked for all the world
like a scene at a Long Island station in August, when the
various New York fathers commute on a Friday afternoon
to spend Saturday and Sunday with their families by the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found my daughter Alice waiting for me at the station
in Brest, and on the way to the little apartment
which she and Miss McKim occupied together, she told
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
me that Admiral Wilson wanted to meet me before my
departure on the transport the same evening. She
begged me to support her if he denounced jazz music,
against which he had a particular hatred, for she had
always insisted to him that the sailors loved it and that
in time of war they certainly should have anything they
wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon the admiral’s band gave a concert in
the public square, and I, of course, attended it and met
the bandmaster and his players, who did very good work,
several of them having been members of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra. They begged me to conduct them in
one of the numbers, and I took up the stick and solemnly
played through the “William Tell Overture” with them.
At the end I saw Admiral Wilson on the balcony of his
apartment applauding vociferously, and he presently
came running, bareheaded, across the square to greet
me. Almost the first thing he said was: “Doctor, don’t
you think jazz music is horrible? It destroys all taste
for real music.” “Indeed I heartily agree with you,” I
answered. Whereupon my daughter Alice turned on me
and said, “Coward!” implying that as the admiral was the
autocrat of Brest I did not wish to brave his wrath even
in order to please my daughter. But indeed I was thoroughly
in accord with him; and I wish that either some
popular substitute could be found for the interminable
jazz that is ravaging not only our country but all Europe,
or that a genius would come along who would pour
into this very low form of art some real emotion which,
welling from the very heart of man, might give life to
what is at present but a nervous excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening I went on board the transport <span class='it'>America</span>,
and sailed for home. I found the voyage exceedingly interesting.
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
The ship had been a Hamburg passenger
liner, the <span class='it'>Amerika</span>, taken over after her internment by our
navy; the “k” having been carefully removed and an
American “c” substituted. Various German signs had
been scratched out, but the table and bed linen, as well
as the knives and forks, still bore the mystic initials,
<span class='it'>H. A. P. A. G.—Hamburg Amerika Paketfahrt Actien
Gesellschaft</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was the proud occupant of a cabin and bathroom of
the so-called “Roosevelt” suite, which the ex-President
had occupied during his trip around the world, and the
faucets over the bathtub still bore the signs “Kalt,”
“Warm,” and “Gemischt.” The various luxurious furnishings
of the ship showed the wear and tear of army-transport
usage. The marble was cracked and the electric
bells did not ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first-class cabins were occupied by several hundred
officers, a curious mixture of men, some returning on
leave or to become instructors in the officers’ camps, or
being mustered out of service, either for ill health,
drunkenness, or incompetence. For days I was pursued,
even into my cabin, by a man from a Western city who
had enlisted as a dentist. He was evidently out of his
mind and was to be mustered out of the service on his
return home. He had conceived the mysterious idea that
I could influence the powers that be to have him reinstated,
and I finally found the glitter in his eye so ominous
that I reported him to the colonel in command and
he promptly had him put under medical observation.
Two days later his companions in the hospital ward, whom
he had already annoyed and frightened by suddenly
grabbing their legs at night, found him in the bathroom
with his throat partly cut by his razor; and I confess that
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
I was glad when I heard that he had been put into a
cabin by himself, with a soldier guarding the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were, of course, under army regulations and in
many respects life was much stricter than on the passenger
liners. We were compelled to wear life-preservers almost
the entire voyage and no lights were permitted after
sundown. We were not told at which American port we
were to land, and I was much astonished one morning to
find our ship anchored in Boston Harbor alongside the old
1812 frigate <span class='it'>Constitution</span>, whose broadside-guns looked
delightfully picturesque and inefficient compared with the
modern monsters I had seen in France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the following winter my wife and I often received
visits from navy officers and sailors bearing greetings
from our daughter Alice in Brest, and I remember
one red-cheeked youngster who made so agreeable an
impression on my wife that she invited him to return the
following day, which was Sunday, for luncheon. On that
morning the telephone rang. It was our old friend,
Admiral William Rodgers, who asked whether he could
come to luncheon. My wife said we would be delighted,
but my youngest daughter Anita, who was well versed in
the etiquette of the navy, called out: “Oh, we can’t have
the admiral lunching with us to-day. An admiral can’t sit
down at the same table with a gob!” My wife repeated
this to the admiral, who insisted that it made no difference
and that in war time everything was possible; that he
certainly wanted to come and would be very glad to meet
the “gob” who had brought greetings from Alice, of whom
he was very fond. The sailor boy arrived first, and when
we told him that our other guest was to be an admiral
he grew pale as death, but when Rodgers arrived he was
so kind to the boy that luncheon passed off fairly well,
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
except that the boy became rigid at attention whenever
the admiral spoke to him. During the luncheon Admiral
Rodgers said to him: “You have just seen Mrs. Pennington
in Brest?” “Yes, sir.” “And what was she doing
when you saw her?” “She was selling postage-stamps,
sir,” was the answer. And I have no doubt this was true,
as Alice in her capacity of naval “Y” worker not only
took the sailors out to picnics with swimming contests,
arranged vaudeville entertainments and concerts, but in
between times sold them chocolate, cigarettes, postage-stamps,
picture postal-cards, lemon-drops, and ginger ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After luncheon my daughters discreetly took the young
sailor into the front parlor in order to relieve the tension
a little, and Rodgers asked me about an orchestration of
the “Star-Spangled Banner” which I had made at the
beginning of the war and which had aroused some attention.
I had always felt that this good old English tune
had a fine ring to it, provided it was played in the proper
tempo, and I had given it an orchestration which developed
into quite a climax on the last two lines of each verse.
I sat down at the piano and played it for him, explaining
the difference between this version and the old one which
had been generally used before the war. He was much
interested and wanted to introduce it in the navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailor boy finally took his departure, and my
daughters came smiling into the music-room and told us
that while they were sitting talking with the sailor, he
suddenly jumped up from his chair and stood at rigid
attention. He had heard the strains of the national anthem
coming from our room and, remembering the admiral,
knew his duty! Who shall, after that, deny the
power of music in peace or in war?</p>

<h3>THE EUROPEAN TOUR</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1919 I received a letter from M. Lafere,
then <span class='it'>Ministre des Beaux Arts</span> in France, which interested
the directors of the New York Symphony Society
and myself exceedingly. In this letter he referred to the
services of the New York Symphony Orchestra and myself
to French art in America and invited us to make a
professional visit to France the following year. He promised
every assistance from the French Government and
assured us of a warm welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flagler immediately decided that this invitation
must be accepted inasmuch as it was the first time a foreign
government had extended such a courtesy to an
American musical organization. He also thought that
our visit coming so soon after the war and including
possibly the countries of the other allies in the war, such
as Belgium, Italy, and England, would not only make a
good impression but would help to establish musical relations
with Europe on a more equal basis. Up till then
the current had been all the other way. European singers
and instrumentalists had been coming to America in a
steady stream for many years, but in the meantime
America had developed several orchestras of her own
which could compare favorably with those of Europe;
and he was very proud that the organization of which he
was president and supporter should have been singled out
for so great an honor and opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
I sailed for Europe in the spring of 1919 to confer with
the Beaux Arts about arrangements for our visit to Paris
and other cities in France, and at the same time I also received
invitations from the governments of Belgium and
Italy to visit their countries with the orchestra. In London
Augustus Littleton, the publisher, head of the old
house of Novello &amp; Co., also received me very cordially
and insisted that our visit to Europe would not be complete
if we did not include London. As England, like
our country, has no Ministry of Fine Arts and can therefore
take no official cognizance of musical affairs, he
immediately and energetically set to work to form a
committee of invitation, headed by King George and
composed of all the foremost composers and conductors
of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Affairs began to shape themselves very favorably, and
our manager, Mr. George Engles, began to map out a
tour of seven weeks, during which we were to visit five
countries and play, in all, twenty-seven concerts. But
in the meantime foreign exchange sank lower and lower
and reports of transportation conditions in Europe were so
gloomy that I began to be seriously doubtful of the possibility
of the proposed tour in the spring of 1920. I finally
decided in January to send our manager to Europe personally
to look over the ground, and at the same time I
expressed my fears to Mr. Flagler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I told him that we would have to pay enormous sums
for travelling expenses, the item of steamer passage alone
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, and that while we
would have to pay our orchestra salaries in American
dollars, our receipts in Europe would be in francs, lire,
etc. The dollar was then selling for seventeen francs in
France and for twenty-three lire in Italy. I suggested
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
to him to postpone the tour until a time when war-torn
Europe would be economically in a better condition and
when her transportation system would again be more
nearly on a pre-war basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flagler listened to me and said: “I do not see how
we can possibly postpone the acceptance of these official
invitations from four countries to a later period. Now is
the psychological moment to do it. How much do you
think the tour will cost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had made a kind of general calculation and mentioned
the amount, which seemed to me large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that curious?” he answered. “That is exactly
what I thought it would cost. Go right ahead with your
preparations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was naturally delighted at his decision. I knew that
American orchestras had achieved a perfection of ensemble
which but few, if any, European orchestras could
equal. I was proud of our organization and anxious to
demonstrate it as a standard of American musical culture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of the orchestra were wild with excitement
at the marvellous news. Many of them had been
born in America and had never seen Europe. It was the
wonderland of their imagination. Others had been there
as soldiers during the war, and still others had left Europe
years before to found their fortunes and families in
the New World and had not been back since. They immediately
appointed a committee to agree upon a minimum
salary schedule which, while giving them a fair
recompense for their time, would yet make that part of
it not too difficult for us. To this sum, however, Mr.
Flagler later added ten dollars a week more for each
player, as he thought that their hotel expenses might be
greater than we had calculated.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
The managerial work of constructing the tour was beset
with many difficulties, as the war had disorganized
many of the regular concert organizations in Europe
under whose auspices we would have played under
normal conditions. The railroads, also, made much
slower time than formerly. But gradually the tour began
to assume shape and the first concert was scheduled to
be given on May 6 at the Grand Opera in Paris, which
the <span class='it'>Ministère des Beaux Arts</span> had offered to us, and the
last concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on
June 20. In order that this tour might be representative
in every way of the best in American music, Mr.
Flagler suggested that we take along two young American-born
soloists of distinction—Albert Spalding, violinist,
and John Powell, composer-pianist. I immediately
set to work to prepare a series of appropriate programmes
which should serve the double purpose of demonstrating
the fine qualities of our orchestra and soloists, and also
pay proper tribute to the great composers of the countries
we proposed to visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were to open with three concerts in Paris, and as I
was conversant with all the details in connection with
Paris especially, I preceded the orchestra and arrived
there April 22. At my hotel, the “France et Choiseul,” I
found a letter from my old friend, Robert Underwood
Johnson, who had just left Paris to go to Rome as American
ambassador to Italy. He said:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'><span class='sc'>Dear Walter</span>:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It is pleasant to think that, within a few days, you will be occupying
the “ambassadorial suite” in which I am writing these lines (Davis
of London had it also). We leave day after tomorrow and shall be
very happy to see you all when you come to Rome. We are looking
forward with pride and agreeable anticipation to the invasion of
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
Italy by the Symphony and its director and the assisting artists.
We have no Embassy, alas! being “all dressed up (or nearly so) with
no place to go to” and so we shall slum it at the Grand Hotel until the
money seems to be giving out.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Don’t let any of your party perish by stumbling over the torn
carpet at the entrance to this apartment. I have tried to have it
mended, but my failure shows that I am no diplomat—yet.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Au revoir. Bientôt à Rome.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>My first act was to have that carpet mended, and I
immediately sent a telegram to the American Embassy
in Rome announcing the important news. And then the
affairs of the tour began to engulf me to such an extent
that until Mr. Engles arrived and relieved me with able
hands of a great deal of that burden, I thought that I was
back again in the old days of the Damrosch Opera Company,
when I was owner, director, orchestral conductor,
stage-manager, and prima donna pacificator all in one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To add to my worries, a railroad strike was announced
for May 1, the day on which the orchestra were to arrive
at Le Havre, and not content with that, the dock workers
of Le Havre intended also to lay down their “tools,”
whatever they may be, and stop working on that date.
When I thought of the musical instruments and trunks
of my orchestra in the hold of the steamer <span class='it'>Rochambeau</span>,
which was to arrive on or about May 1, my heart stopped
beating. However, I had been in too many close shaves
on my great Western orchestral tours to be altogether
dismayed, for even if the railroad stopped running there
would always be motor-trucks and airplanes. We had
made arrangements with Thomas Cook and Sons to take
care of all transportation matters from the day the orchestra
arrived in France until their sailing for home from
England, and they assured me that, if necessary, they
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
would have camions, such as were used during the war,
to carry my whole orchestra, together with their baggage
and musical instruments, from Le Havre to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luckily the ship docked several hours before the
dock workers’ strike began, and double-basses, kettledrums,
and innumerable music boxes were safely landed
from the hold of the ship. I had intended to go to Le
Havre to meet the orchestra, but the strike conditions
were too uncertain and I thought it better to remain in
Paris and direct operations from there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The government was moving several trains, and the
telegram that the orchestra had started for Paris cheered
me up considerably. I was at the station at 3.30 that
afternoon, to be met with the news that the train was
delayed and would be in at six. At six there was no
sign of it, and, as is usual at French stations, there was
absolutely no one who had any idea when it might arrive.
I stayed there till eight o’clock—no train. Finally there
was a whistle. Every one dashed out. It was a freight-train,
but, like the dove from Noah’s Ark, I saw the “man
from Cook’s,” a little man, attired then and during the
entire tour in a very small derby hat and an exceedingly
long double-breasted frock coat, sitting on top of one of
the cars. He was tired, dirty, but triumphant, for all
our musical instruments and music boxes were in these
cars. He had passed the orchestra half-way at Rouen,
where they were held up by a hot box. This sounded
like home to me, as I had heard those magic words only
too often when our train, coming through Idaho or Arizona
on our way to or from California, would be held up
for hours and we would wonder whether we could “make”
the concert that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orchestra had rehearsed our repertoire with me so
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
thoroughly before we sailed that but little more was
necessary. I gave them three rehearsals, however, before
our first concert, the first two at the <span class='it'>Salle du Conservatoire</span>,
to shake them together again after their long voyage,
and the last on the afternoon of the concert, May 6,
at the Opera House in order to accustom them to its
acoustics. The orchestra played so superbly at the two
first rehearsals that I was jubilant and proud of them.
The ensemble was perfect and each man played as if the
success of the concert depended on him—which it certainly
did. But when we began rehearsing at the Opera
House the tone of the orchestra suddenly seemed so thin
and lifeless that I was nearly beside myself with anxiety.
The orchestra was placed on the stage, but the local
management had not seen fit to provide us with any
proper scenic setting or roof, so that the sound of our
large and noble orchestra was completely dissipated in
the flies. When I remonstrated, I was told that they
had a roof for the stage but that it was in the storehouse,
situated beyond the fortifications of Paris, and that this
was the first time in many years the Opera House had
been used for a concert. They finally agreed to have at
least half a roof up for our concert and to set a smaller
scene, which would contain the sound and throw it
into the audience-room in more compact fashion. After
twenty minutes or so of rehearsing, I threw down my
stick and told the men to call it a day. I went back to
my hotel very depressed, as so much depended on the first
impression which our orchestra would make that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
The reader will notice that we placed on it two works
by living French composers, both of whom were to be
at the concert. The house was completely sold out, and
greeted me in very friendly fashion when I came on the
stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the very first chords of the “Eroica” Symphony,
I noticed that the slight improvements in our scenic surroundings,
and above all the fact that the house was
filled with people, had acted like magic on the acoustics.
The tone of the orchestra had become full, clear, and incisive.
My spirits rose and I forgot everything except
the orchestra before me and Beethoven’s score. After
each movement the applause was deafening, and at the
end of the symphony there was joyous shouting from the
galleries. We seemed to have played our way into their
hearts, and after the first part there was a steady stream
of French musicians to my dressing-room to congratulate
me on our marvellous orchestra and its ensemble, and to
express their delight that we had come over on such a
friendly mission. Among them were: Vincent d’Indy,
Gabriel Fauré, André Messager, Gabriel Pierné, Theodore
Dubois, Paul Vidal, Nadia Boulanger, and many
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we turned into the French part of our programme
the enthusiasm became still greater, and at the conclusion
of “Istar” some of my first violins discovered the
composer, d’Indy, in the audience and, pointing toward
him, stood up to applaud. In a minute not only the
whole orchestra but the audience were on their feet
and with loud cries of “Auteur!” “d’Indy!” the house
was in an uproar until d’Indy, his face as red as a beet,
was compelled to rise and acknowledge this tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The programme finished with the marvellous “Daphnis
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
et Chloe,” by Ravel, in which the luscious tone of the
orchestra and its virtuosity demonstrated themselves so
successfully that not only did the concert come to a tumultuous
climax, but several of the French papers announced
afterward that this work had never had such a
vivid and perfect rendering before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My interpretation of the Beethoven “Eroica” Symphony
puzzled some of the newspaper critics, as it did not
conform to their French traditions. These do not permit
such slight occasional modifications of tempo as modern
conductors brought up in the German traditions of
Beethoven believe essential to a proper interpretation of
this master. But I was much pleased and honored to
receive a complete approval of my interpretation, not
only verbally from several of my French colleagues, but
also from M. d’Indy in an article which he wrote on our
concert and in which he said:</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Leaving aside everything that Walter Damrosch has done for our
country and the French musicians, generous acts for which our gratitude
has often been expressed, I wish mainly to pay my tribute to the
extremely expressive interpretation at the concerts he has given
lately at the Opera. Whether it is classical, romantic, or modern
music, Damrosch first of all endeavors to set off and illustrate what
we call the “melos,” the element of expression, the voice that must
rise above all the other voices of the orchestra. He knows how to
distribute the agogic action, the dynamic power, and he is not afraid—even
in Beethoven’s works and in spite of the surprise this caused
to our public—to accelerate or slacken the movement when the
necessities of expression demand it.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The French are a courteous people, and at the end of
the concert there was an even greater crowd of musicians
and friends behind the scenes to express their pleasure
at our success.</p>

</table>

<p class='pindent'>The two young American artists, Albert Spalding and
John Powell, made a splendid impression, and of the orchestral
works the Prelude to the “Meistersingers” of
Wagner and the Mozart and Franck Symphonies received
special acclaim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was delightful to hear the half-suppressed “Ah’s”
and “Bravos!” so characteristic of the French audience
after the Andante of the Mozart Symphony. I confess
that the more spontaneous approval which European
audiences give in drama, opera, or concert is exceedingly
gratifying and stimulates the artist to the very best that
is in him. Every artist who is worth his salt will always
approach an audience with the feeling that they are as
strangers whom through his art he must win over as
friends. This feeling exists whether he makes his first
bow as a beginner or appears for the three thousandth
time after twenty years of public work. It is a wonderful
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
moment for him when, after having done his best and
given all there is in him, his audience show by the intensity
of their approval that the “song which he breathed
into the air” has found its home “in the heart of a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sunday morning, May 9, at eleven, the orchestra
of the Conservatoire gave a great party in our honor as a
return courtesy for one that we had given to the French
Orchestra on their arrival in America in 1918. We all met
at the <span class='it'>Salle du Conservatoire</span> where M. Leon, representing
the Ministry of Fine Arts, was waiting to receive me.
With the Conservatoire Orchestra were various French
masters, including the venerable Gabriel Fauré, and
Messager, the conductor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After various speeches of welcome, I was presented
with a beautiful engraving of Beethoven and made an
honorary member of the Conservatoire Orchestra. We
then marched to the <span class='it'>Taverne du Nègre</span>, where luncheon
was served. There were so many different kinds of wine-glasses
before each plate that I asked permission to make
a short speech in English to my orchestra. It consisted
of the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, remember we have a concert this afternoon,
so please mix your wine with much water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Needless to say, in all the speeches the theme of the
war was constantly played upon by the French orators—how
much France owed to our intervention and to the
bravery of our soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would have been very pleasant to stay on in Paris,
where our orchestra were beginning to feel very much at
home, and rest upon our young laurels, but our tour had
only begun and we had to carry on!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Mr. Engles and our treasurer, Roger
Townsend, had to smooth out all kinds of new difficulties
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
and complications, among which the passport nuisance
was the greatest. War conditions still prevailed and
passports had to be carefully viséd by the ambassadors
of every country we visited. All our orchestra were
practically Americans, but technically they belonged to
America, France, Belgium, Italy, England, Russia, Germany,
Austria, and Czecho-Slovakia. Many of them
had had only their first American papers when the war
broke out, and according to war regulations could not
yet obtain their American citizens’ papers. They were
therefore compelled to travel on foreign passports and
some of their visés were exceedingly difficult to obtain, as
new countries like Czecho-Slovakia, for instance, had not
yet a properly organized diplomatic service. Others,
like Russia, were not recognized at all and our Russians
had to travel on Kerensky passports issued for them by
the Kerensky ambassador who was still “holding the fort”
in Washington. Through the kindly help of Mr. Grew,
councillor at our embassy in Paris, and other friends in
high places, we finally obtained our hundred visés and
left Paris for Bordeaux on May 11, and—in spite of the
railroad strike—with the passage of our train assured as
far as Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only fly in the ointment was a little revolution
before we left the station. Some of the members of the
orchestra had brought their wives and even a few small
children to Europe with them. They very naturally
desired to give their families a good time and wanted
to have them with them and in the orchestra cars on the
entire trip. As railroad space was exceedingly limited
and the bachelor and straw-widower members of the orchestra
strenuously objected to this addition, I had to
veto the plan, and painted the difficulties of travel,
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
hotels, passports, etc., in such lurid fashion that I succeeded
in preventing their departure from Paris with us.
The husbands promised to leave their families in Paris
until our return, about three weeks later, but as all the
wives and children came to the station to see their respective
husbands and fathers off, I was nervous until
the last doors of the car were slammed to and the whistle
of the French locomotive, which always sounds like the
shrill wail of the damned, announced that we were
really off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orchestra were in a very gay mood and insisted on
getting out every time the train stopped even a second,
and then having to be pulled back as the train started
again without any warning. A passport picture of one
unfortunate little second violinist was sent through all
the cars, pasted on a piece of paper with the inscription:
“Wanted for bigamy. Member of the New York Symphony
Orchestra. Reward of three francs if returned
dead or alive to George Engles, Manager.” This had
been perpetrated by Willem Willeke, who was not only a
master violoncellist but the master mind behind almost
every practical joke indulged in during the tour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We arrived in Bordeaux that evening and were welcomed
at our hotel by a typical little hotel manager, with
his head entirely bald on top but beautifully covered with
the long hair combed forward from the back of his head.
He also had a full beard neatly parted in the middle,
and of course a long double-breasted frock coat. He
rubbed his hands with the pleasure of welcoming us and
assured us that all our rooms were properly reserved.
Actually it took us three-quarters of an hour to get ourselves
and our baggage straightened out in the proper
rooms. Our party consisted of Albert and Mrs. Spalding,
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
John Powell, Mary Flagler, my daughter Gretchen, and
myself, and the highly efficient manager had sent each
one of us at first to the wrong rooms while our bags had
still further gone astray. But a good bath and a delicious
dinner at the famous <span class='it'>Chapon Fin</span> put us all in
good humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The theatre at which we were to play the following
evening was directly opposite to our hotel and its frontal
façade is without doubt the most beautiful I have ever
seen. Such examples of the finest architecture of the
eighteenth century stand out in remarkable contrast to
their more modern surroundings and it is difficult to understand
how French architects, with such noble examples
to follow and with a school in Paris which is still
considered the best in the world, should have allowed
their art to degenerate to such an extent within the last
thirty years. One has but to compare the noble façade
of the Place de la Concorde with such modern monstrosities
as, for instance, the Hotel Mercedes or the Palais
de Justice at Tours, to realize that in their endeavor to
break away completely from their own noblest traditions
they have deliberately courted anarchy, for their architecture
rests upon no laws of beauty or symmetry. Many
of our best American architects are graduates from the
École des Beaux Arts in Paris, but they have not become
revolutionaries and have understood how to adapt their
appreciation of the best French traditions to American
needs. The results demonstrate an art of which every
American can be proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our concert, which was given under the auspices of the
local symphony society, was received with great favor.
The interior of the theatre is delightfully intimate, and the
audience gave the impression of belonging to an old
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
musical civilization. We were presented with huge
bouquets of flowers tied with the American colors. Albert
Spalding’s performance made a splendid impression,
and the “Meistersinger” Overture came in for special
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was my astonishment at suddenly beholding
three of the “orchestra wives,” who were supposed to
have remained in Paris, seated in one of the boxes. I
do not know to this day whether they rode on the bumpers
or in one of the baggage-cars. However, they were
charming ladies; and, as a married man, I could not be too
angry with them or their indulgent husbands. We compromised
in the matter by permitting them to continue
with us for the rest of the tour, provided that they and
their husbands occupied space elsewhere than that reserved
for the orchestra, and that they looked out
for their own passports whenever we approached the
border.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we returned to our hotel after the concert the smiling
hotel manager stood in the lobby to receive us and to
express his congratulations at the success of a <span class='it'>concert
merveilleux</span>. As we entered the electric lift to go to our
respective rooms, he himself shut the grating on us and
pressed the button to send us slowly upward. (All
French lifts move slowly.) Its almost celestial calmness
irresistibly brought the Finale of Gounod’s “Faust” to
my mind, when <span class='it'>Marguerite</span> ascends heavenward. I began
to sing the melody of the “<span class='it'>Anges radieux</span>,” and
just as we got up to the first floor we suddenly heard the
voice of the hotel manager, a vibrant tenor, enthusiastically
continuing the trio from below. I gazed downward
and there he was, his face raised ecstatically toward
us and his hand pressed to his double-breasted frock
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
coat—perhaps a poor hotel manager but certainly an enthusiastic
lover of music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newspapers of Bordeaux were full of praise about
our concert, but one of them said: “The orchestra played
with that dryness characteristic of all North Americans.”
Alack and alas! Had the Eighteenth Amendment, which
went into effect the previous January, already made its
dreadful influence felt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lyons was to be the next city on our itinerary, but unfortunately
the railroad strike had completely isolated it
and there was no way of reaching it from Bordeaux. We
were therefore very reluctantly compelled to cancel the
concert. Every seat had been sold long before, and as
Lyons ranked next to Paris in musical importance the
cancellation was a great disappointment to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Engles brought me a telegram which
he had just received from our general manager in Paris,
to the effect that at Marseilles the hall in which we were
to play had been condemned by the fire department as
unsafe, and that therefore the concert would have to be
given at another theatre and under different management.
Engles did not like the look of things and begged me, as
he could not speak French, to go with him to Marseilles
and look over the ground with him. We were to have
played in Marseilles under the auspices and management
of the local symphonic organization, which, however,
turned out to be but a small and not very influential body
of musicians, most of whom were amateurs. Their secretary,
who was to attend to the details of management,
was a newspaper man and an amateur double-bass player,
of which instrument he was very proud. When we arrived,
only two days before the concert, we found that
absolutely nothing had been done to advertise it. There
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
were no posters, no advertisements, and the manager of
the theatre to which we had been transferred did not even
know before our arrival whether we were a jazz band of
colored people from America or perhaps a troupe of wandering
minstrels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were to give two concerts, and at first it seemed as
if, under such disheartening circumstances, it were better
to cancel them and proceed to Monte Carlo and Italy,
where already sold-out houses awaited us. The newspaper
man, who was the real delinquent, was nowhere to
be found. He had gone to the country “<span class='it'>pour se reposer</span>”
and was not expected until the following day. Luckily
the theatre manager proved to be of the right sort.
When he saw what our organization really stood for he
would not hear of cancellation, and immediately went
around to all the newspaper offices with Engles. Posters,
the principal method of advertising in Europe, appeared
on the street corners as if by magic; and while it
was too late to attract a large audience for the first concert,
he assured us that if this concert were the success
which he expected, the theatre, which held about twenty-four
hundred people, would be entirely sold out for the
second concert on Sunday afternoon. His prophecy
proved correct. There were not more than eight hundred
people at the first concert, but as they were real sons of
the <span class='it'>Midi</span> and as they had never heard a symphonic organization
of such size and importance in their lives, they
went mad. They applauded with their hands, with both
feet, with their canes and umbrellas. They shouted in
eight-part harmonies and the rafters of the theatre
trembled in sympathy. After the concert they lined up
at the box-office in a great crowd while the theatre manager,
grinning from ear to ear, said: “Did I not tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
In the meantime the delinquent local secretary-manager
turned up and I was fully prepared to annihilate him for
his lack of proper preliminary advertising for our concert,
but as he immediately called me “Cher maître” and expressed
his delight in such eloquent French at the coming
of so notable an organization as ours, he completely
spiked my guns and I found myself unable to get in
a word edgewise, much less tell him what I really thought
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have told before that he was an amateur double-bass
player in the local orchestra, and this was evidently the
ruling passion of his life, although I never could understand
why an amateur should choose this particular instrument
for his delectation. After the second concert
and while the hall was still ringing with the shouts of the
fiery citizens of Marseilles, he came into my dressing-room
as I thought to add his tribute of praise, but, alas, all he
said was: “Cher maître, I could hardly hear your double-bass
players during the entire concert.” I presume that
at the concerts of his orchestra he was so taken up with
his own double-bass part that as he played he heard nothing
of the other instruments around and about him. He
became, so to speak, intoxicated with the resonance of
his own instrument. At our concert, seated in the audience,
he suddenly found, poor man, that the double-bass
was not the only pebble on the orchestral beach, and that
occasionally the violins, the wood winds, or the brasses
had also something of importance to enunciate. It must
have been a sad revelation to him, and I do not wonder
that he refused to accept it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the strike fever was spreading in
every direction, and there was not a trolley running
through the town of Marseilles nor a boat leaving the
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
harbor. The effect was a very curious one, as the streets
were filled with great crowds restlessly moving up and
down, and seemingly without work or affairs of any kind
to keep them busy. In several of the streets small bands
were playing in roped-off circles while thirty couples or so
were dancing madly around with hundreds of others
outside the ropes watching them. The huge audience
who arrived for our Sunday afternoon concert must have
come on foot, as there was not a wheel turning anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After we got back to the hotel the great iron doors were
suddenly closed and bolted, for quite a riot started in
front of it. The trolley company was trying to run a
car through the city, manned by young mechanics from
the School of Technology, and every once in a while a
mob of strikers would rush at them, break the windows
of the car, and pull off the young strike-breakers. But
it was all done in rather an amiable fashion, while a crowd
of men in light straw hats applauded with their hands
and shouted “Bravo,” all as if it were a performance
gotten up for their pleasure. Then a couple of amiable
gendarmes would come along and in the same placid
fashion place the young men on the car again, which
would then proceed for another few yards or so. Suddenly,
however, this seeming comedy took a tragic turn.
The mob made a vicious lunge; they were stopped by the
police who suddenly acted with great energy, and soon
there were several men seriously hurt. In the meantime
the strike-breakers had again connected their car with the
electric wire, and although the car with its broken windows
looked a perfect wreck, it moved triumphantly along
the tracks and the strike was broken. Next morning
every car was running again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later that afternoon I received a visit from Morris
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
Tivin, the first double-bass player of our orchestra. He
brought with him a boy of fifteen, a little Russian Jew,
who had a most remarkable history. He had escaped
from a prison in Russia and worked his way to Constantinople.
As he was a violinist of exceptional ability, he
had made a meagre living there playing in the cafés.
Having read in some old Paris paper that we were to
give a concert in Marseilles he had quickly made up his
mind to get there and perhaps through our help reach
the promised land of America. He arrived in Marseilles
as a stowaway after incredible hardships, and when he
introduced himself to some of his Russian compatriots
in my orchestra, he was literally starving and without a
cent in his pockets. Within a few hours our orchestra
had subscribed enough money to send him to New York
with several letters to their colleagues at the Musical
Union, and within a week after his arrival he was engaged
as second concert master at a large salary in one of our
Western orchestras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The generous spirit displayed by our men, which demonstrated
itself in so quick and practical a fashion, is
characteristic of the rank and file of our profession. I
have never known a case of an orchestra musician or
chorus singer in need that his colleagues were not immediately
ready to help, and as their own earnings are comparatively
small their generosity is much greater in proportion
than that of many a rich man whose name figures
largely among the subscribers to our charitable organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our next concert was to be in Monte Carlo, and I
motored with my wife from Marseilles along the Riviera,
reaching Monte Carlo on the evening of May 17. The
orchestra had already arrived by train and were to be
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
found all over the town photographing points of interest,
especially the beautiful statue erected to Hector
Berlioz, which we were all glad to honor. Every orchestra
musician adores this great master, who in his
scores has done more than any other to develop new
tone combinations in the symphonic orchestra since Beethoven
and before Wagner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great many of our men naturally went to the Casino
to behold the world-famous gambling tables, but if I
ever had any worries about their squandering their earnings
they quite disappeared. Many only watched at the
outer edge, or else bet one chip very timidly. An aged
harpy, who looked as though she had played at Monte
Carlo since the time of Napoleon III and who kept a
note-book of her losses and winnings and never bet less
than a hundred francs at a time, took it upon herself to
teach one of our talented young flute players how to play
with one white chip. She kept him in a state of the most
panting thrills, while she placed his bets for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning I found a note from Jean de Reszke
telling me that he, his wife, and Amhurst Webber would
motor over from Nice for the concert, and asking my wife
and me to lunch with him at the Grand Hotel de Paris,
where we were staying. It was such a joy to see him
again. We had not met since 1902, when he had been at
the Metropolitan at the height of his fame and I had
conducted many a glorious “Tristan” performance with
him in the title rôle. Amhurst Webber, a highly talented
English musician, had then been with him as pianist and
I had helped him a little with his studies in composition
and instrumentation. Mme. de Reszke I had never had
the pleasure of meeting before. A great tragedy had
come upon her, as their only son had been killed in the
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
first year of the war. It was heart-breaking to see her, as
her face told the story of her irreparable loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concert in the afternoon took place in the exquisite
little theatre at the Casino. It seats only about
four hundred people and of course every seat was occupied.
Jean de Reszke was in the fifth row of the parquet,
and as I came to the “Prize Song” in the “Meistersinger”
Overture, which he had sung so often and so
ravishingly in New York, I could not help but turn
around to look at him. He gave me an immediate smile,
but the tears were running down his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the concert I was solemnly informed by
the very polite little intendant of the theatre that M.
Blanc, the principal owner of the Casino, the opera, the
gambling tables, the Hotel de Paris, in fact everything
which draws the hundred-franc notes from the grateful
tourist, had expressed a desire to meet me and to thank
me for the “<span class='it'>concert exquis</span>.” I was accordingly piloted to
another part of the building, where, in an anteroom, five
or six people were waiting as if in a doctor’s outer office,
while flunkies in livery were silently walking around
or delivering whispered messages to this or that man.
One of these approached my little intendant with a
message, who turned to me and, with a face radiant with
pride, said: “Think of it! He will see us first before all
the others!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We followed the flunky into an inner room where I
found a tired-looking, gray-mustached little man whom
I had noticed sleeping in one of the boxes during about
half an hour of the concert. He congratulated me on the
“splendid concert and the exquisite playing of the orchestra,”
and as I sat there I marvelled at it all. Here was
a man whom we in America would call a gambling-house
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
keeper, but he is certainly a king among them. He has
provided his gambling tables with a setting so exquisite
that words cannot describe it. Nature in her most charming
mood, beautiful architecture, delightful music, exquisite
cooking—all these so skilfully combined as to
create an agreeable atmosphere for the thousands who
come every year with full pockets and generally leave
with empty ones. Incidentally he makes millions by
thus cleverly pandering to the gambling instincts which
are inherent in almost every man (and woman).</p>

<p class='pindent'>To me the most delightful feature of the concert, except
of course the visit of Jean de Reszke, was a large
audience of seventy-five who sat behind the scenes as there
was no room for them in front. They were the orchestra
of the Monte Carlo Opera, an excellent body of men who
embraced us in true southern fashion between the parts
and at the end of the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning I continued the trip by motor to
Genoa. As there had been no strike of any kind in
Monte Carlo I thought that our hoodoo had lifted, but,
lo and behold, at Genoa we found only one old, gray-bearded
portier at our hotel to greet us. All the waiters,
porters, chambermaids, cooks, scullions, in fact everything
that could strike in connection with a hotel, were on
strike and the discomfort was considerable. We had
looked forward with pleasurable anticipation to our first
Italian dinner. We had dreamed of fritto misto, spaghetti,
and of delicious Italian ices, but these dreams quickly
vanished. There was not even a crust of bread to be obtained
at the hotel. Finally we were furtively conducted
through an alley into the back entrance of a little restaurant
by way of the kitchen, and there we obtained
some food, but of the simplest and poorest variety. The
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
next morning a cup of wretched coffee and a piece of
stale bread at the railroad station made our breakfast,
but luckily for us a kind young American, Mr. Allan,
called on us and whisked us off in his car to his house,
where a delicious luncheon made us forget our deprivations
of the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was again amazed at the cleverness with which
the members of our orchestra adapted themselves to
European travelling conditions. They had all found
excellent restaurants and had really fared much better
than we.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gave our concert at the <span class='it'>Teatro Carlo Felice</span>, and our
first Italian audience proved to be even more noisy in
their demonstrations of pleasure than the <span class='it'>Midi</span>. I was
very much touched to receive a large wreath tied with
the stars and stripes, from the American Consul-General,
who told me after the concert that he considered such a
cultural mission as we were engaged in of as much importance
for cordial relations between our country and
Italy as any business enterprise. He said that music
meant so much to the Italian that he was amazed and
delighted to find that Americans did not only interest
themselves in business but also cultivated the arts. As
the Italians had been so bitterly disillusioned regarding
President Wilson, after the phenomenally enthusiastic
acclaim which they had given him on his visit to Rome
only a year before, I was not surprised to have one old
gentleman say to me after the concert: “We do not like
your President, but we love the Americans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left next morning by train for Rome. The highly
talented young composer, Signor Vincenzo Tommasini,
had interested himself in our concerts there and had enlisted
the sympathies of the Accademia Santa Cecilia,
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
under whose auspices we were to play at the Augusteo.
The Santa Cecilia, which is composed of musicians and
music lovers, is perhaps the oldest musical organization
in the world, as it was founded by Palestrina. Under the
presidency of Count San Martino it maintains a symphony
orchestra which gives a series of concerts during the winter
under its own conductor, Maestro Molinari, and various
guest conductors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these concerts are given at the Augusteo, so called
because it was built by Augustus as a tomb for the
Cæsars. It is a rotunda built of the old Roman bricks,
but balconies, a stage, and an organ have been added to
it in recent times to adapt it to modern concert needs.
It very likely was an excellent tomb, but its acoustics are
hardly suited for an orchestra. I do not know of any
concert-hall built in circular shape that is satisfactory in
that respect. The sound vibrations seem to travel around
and around and great confusion of tones is the result, especially
in such music where changing harmonies succeed
each other rapidly. At our little preliminary rehearsal
the hall was empty with the exception of half a dozen
members of the Santa Cecilia, and as we began to play
through a few bars of the symphony I thought I had
suddenly become deaf, as the sound of the orchestra did
not reach me where I stood. But I remembered our first
experience at the Grand Opera House in Paris and trusted
to better conditions when the hall was full. This hope
was justified, as the tone of the orchestra was much
clearer and better balanced at the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first and second movements of the “Eroica”
Symphony there were great applause and shouts of
“Bravo!” from the boxes and parquet, but this was immediately
followed by very disconcerting whistling from
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
the top gallery, which seemed to develop into a kind of
duel between the two factions. I was somewhat disconcerted
at this and thought that perhaps something in
our playing had not pleased the galleries, but my friends
of the Accademia Santa Cecilia assured me that this was
nothing but a characteristic little demonstration which
often occurred at their concerts. If the parquet and
boxes approved of some particular composition or rendition
the galleries felt it incumbent upon them to oppose
it. I do not know how true this explanation is, but during
the concert the whistling suddenly ceased and after the
“Riccardo Wagner. Tristan e Isotta, Preludio e Morte
di Isotta (Lipsia 1813—Venezia 1883),” as the Italian
programme had it, the two factions seemed to have
buried their hatchets completely and were in absolute
harmony as far as their enthusiastic acclaim toward us
was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the two days following, the Romans overwhelmed
us with hospitalities. The heat was terrific, but
the entire orchestra responded to an invitation to be
presented to the mayor and to visit the Capitoline Museum,
where they were offered a private view of its art
treasures, followed by a luncheon given by the municipality
in the adjoining ruins of the Tabolarium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning Tommasini, Molinari, and
a few others of my musician colleagues sauntered into my
salon and suggested that we go to a concert given that
morning at the Borghese Gardens by the famous Banda
Communale di Roma. The heat was so overwhelming
that I shuddered at the idea of standing under the blazing
noonday sun listening to a concert, especially as I had to
conduct our own second concert on that afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please come,” said Tommasini.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
“No, indeed,” I said. “It is far too hot and I want to
do good work this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the concert is given in your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gracious! Why didn’t you tell me that immediately?
Come along!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grabbed my hat and we drove to the Borghese Gardens,
where a crowd of several thousand people were
gathered around the bandstand and where Maestro
Vecella was conducting his band in a beautiful rendition
of the Prelude to Wagner’s “Parsifal.” It was a wonderful
performance. His clarinets played the opening unison
phrase with a vibrant and singing quality that I have
rarely heard equalled, and I was struck by the rapt silence
with which the huge audience of Italians listened to it. I,
unfortunately, arrived too late to hear the rendition of
Beethoven’s “Fifth Symphony,” which Vecella himself had
arranged for military band and which my musicians afterward
told me had been beautifully performed. The concert
came to a close with a selection of airs from one of the
popular modern Italian operas. To my astonishment and
delight, as the band began to play this or that air, evidently
well known to the audience, groups of men around
the bandstand joined in singing it with the orchestra
<span class='it'>mezza voce</span>, but with that perfect quality of tone which is
inborn in the Italian race. And then, as the sounds of
one group would die out, another from the other side
would take it up, and this continued until the end of the
number. It was a delightful demonstration of the innate
musical genius of the Italian people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forgot temporarily that the sun was blazing down with
a fierceness almost unendurable, but after I had thanked
Maestro Vecella for this truly wonderful concert, I begged
Molinari and Tommasini to take me back to my hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
“Stay a little while longer,” said Tommasini.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible!” I answered. “I am melting away and
there will be nothing left of me if I do not get to some
shaded spot soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but you will,” he said. “The Banda Communale
are now going to present you with the gold medal of the
society, with a special inscription.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why in heaven’s name did you not tell me this
sooner?” I said to my friend, but he simply smiled his
inscrutable Italian smile and lit another cigarette. With
the resolve to do or die, I marched along with them to a
private room in a restaurant adjoining the Gardens and
there ices and vermuth were served to the members of
the two musical organizations, and I was presented with
the gold Roman medal, which I treasure very highly as
coming from so remarkable a body of players as the Banda
Communale di Roma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some years I have been interested in the new musical
development that is going on in Italy. There had been a
period when her church music led the world in the variety
and beauty of its form. Later on, especially in the
eighteenth century, she had produced many composers
of distinction in instrumental music, but from then on
and until very recent times, opera had almost completely
monopolized her writers. The splendid opera-houses
which are to be found in her smallest towns are eloquent
testimony to the important place which that form of art
occupies in the hearts of the Italian people. Every
Italian can sing, and the critics and lovers of opera are
to be found just as much among the poorer classes as
among the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all the testimony of older musicians with whom I
have spoken and who have travelled through Italy is to
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
the effect that her orchestras formerly were of a very
poor quality. Their playing was slovenly and rehearsals
few and insufficient. Many of the players in the opera-houses
of even the larger cities followed some other
calling in the daytime, and there was many a tailor or
shoemaker who played his violin in the evening at the
opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the last twenty-five years, however, a complete
and almost miraculous change has come over musical conditions
throughout Italy. Its conservatories in Rome,
Milan, Bologna, and Naples turn out excellent players, and
several of her conductors rank with the best of other
countries. Signor Mancinelli, for instance, who was my
colleague during the years that I conducted at the Metropolitan
for Maurice Grau, was a first-class musician and
conductor, well versed in more than Italian music. He
was a great lover of Mozart and gave beautiful performances
of the “Magic Flute” at the Metropolitan. He
envied me my job of conducting the Wagner operas and
later on conducted many of them in Italy and Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toscanini is one of the greatest conductors living to-day.
His range extends to the music of all countries,
and I have heard him conduct Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,”
Verdi’s “Falstaff,” and Wagner’s “Meistersinger”
in one week with equal penetration into their
beauties and, incidentally, without an orchestral score
in front of him. He has made a virtue of necessity, as
he is almost blind and has therefore developed his power
of memory to a greater extent than I have ever seen in
any other musician, not even excepting Hans von Bülow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of Italy’s more serious attitude toward instrumental
music shows itself not only in the quality of
Italian orchestras, but in a group of highly talented young
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
composers who devote their principal efforts to symphonic
music, and who are creating works that rank with
the best that other countries are now producing. Several
years ago I produced an orchestral suite written by a boy
of sixteen, Victor di Sabata, which showed remarkable
talent and fine orchestral coloring. Such men as Resphighi,
Sinigaglia, Tommasini, Casella, Pizzetti, and Malipiero
have found frequent places on our programmes, and
I expect still further contributions, constantly growing
in importance, from this new development of the musical
genius of Italy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was much touched by the interest which our ambassador,
Mr. Johnson, constantly showed in our success
and well-being. He had invited the Queen Mother and
several of the young Princesses to our concerts, and at
the many official and governmental functions which I
had to attend he was a sympathetic companion and real
brother artist. He always responded very felicitously
when occasion demanded, and all my Italian musician
friends loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a farewell supper which I gave on the last night
John Powell, whose negro Fantasy had interested our
Italian audiences greatly, and the composer, Malipiero,
sat next to each other, but as John speaks English and
Malipiero Italian and French, the silence between them
for about ten minutes was deep and profound. Suddenly
they broke into the most fluent conversation and the
words burst forth in torrents. They had suddenly discovered
to their mutual delight that the German language
was a common meeting-ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left Rome very reluctantly. Quite apart from the
many personal friends that I had made there, its eternal
beauty again enveloped me and bade me stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
I cannot imagine any movement or institution better
calculated to help young American artists to further develop
and stimulate their creative abilities than the
American Academy in Rome. It has quite recently
added three music fellowships to those for painters,
sculptors, architects, and archæologists, and, as it has
done me the honor to elect me as one of the trustees and
the still greater honor of giving my name to one of the
music fellowships, I revisited Rome in the spring of 1922
especially to observe the workings of our academy. I was
amazed and delighted beyond words. The academy is intended
for young artists who have already acquired the
technic of their profession. They are selected by competition
and are given absolute freedom from bread worries
for three years, the first two of which they spend at the
home of the academy, the Villa Aurelia. During the
third year they may travel or live anywhere in Europe
where they think their artistic aims can be further advanced.
Rome and its surroundings are so romantic
and its art treasures so unique that the perception of
beauty and its crystallization into works of art cannot
fail to be further stimulated in those of our American
boys who have the good fortune to achieve a fellowship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, of course, impossible for any man-made institution
to guarantee that every incumbent will develop into
a great genius, but it is certain that as only the best are
chosen, they will become still better through such happy
three years, and if among every two hundred only one
real genius is found and thus encouraged the academy
will have justified its existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of our music fellows had already arrived at the
academy, Leo Sowerby, of Chicago, and Howard Hanson,
of San Jose, California, and had immediately, with characteristic
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
American energy, made themselves part and
parcel of Roman musical life. The Italian musicians had
welcomed them with open arms, and our boys were constantly
found at the concerts and rehearsals of the Santa
Cecilia or having some of their Italian musician friends
at the Villa Aurelia for chamber-music, and a cup of tea
in the beautiful gardens surrounding the villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America owes a great debt of gratitude to Major Felix
Lamond, through whose single-mindedness of purpose
and energy the fund has been collected which has made
the three music fellowships possible. He is now continuing
the work by giving his life to the music department
of the academy, and as its director acts as guide, counsellor,
and friend to its young incumbents. I must confess
that during my visit I had the constant yearning
that I might be forty years younger and could spend three
wonderful years in Rome under such ideal conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last night Major Lamond, his wife, and I dined on
the roof of the Villa Aurelia with Director Stevens, who
is in supreme charge of the entire academy. According
to Roman custom dinner began after nine o’clock. Beneath
us and stretching out toward the Campagna was
the entire city of Rome with its electric lights appearing
like magic in every direction. Beyond the Campagna
rose the mountains, still visible in the faint twilight.
Opposite to us rose the hill of the Pincio Gardens, and on
the left, just visible over the tree tops, flamed the cross of
Saint Peter’s. The silence was profound until suddenly
the bells of Rome began to vibrate from all directions,
and finally, faint but clear, came the sound of a bugle
from the military barracks, blowing the retreat. By this
time I was sunk in a silent ecstasy, but a further climax
was yet in store for me, for as the last notes of the bugle
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
trembled into silence a nightingale from the bushes directly
below us began to pour forth her song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Florence came next on our orchestral tour and I looked
forward with eagerness after our crowded days of official
receptions and concerts to a day absolutely free from
duties of any kind. We arrived on May 24, and I hoped
to sleep deep and late, but at nine o’clock next morning
there was a knock at my door, and without any further
preliminary warning in walked a young gentleman, who
introduced himself as the representative of the mayor of
Florence, who “sends regrets that he cannot be here himself
but wishes me to give Maestro Damrosch the speech
of welcome.” I begged him to excuse me for a few minutes
and attired myself so that I could receive the mayor’s
kind welcome in a more fitting garb and room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our concert was at the splendid Politeama Theatre, a
great amphitheatre with fine acoustics. Albert Spalding
was our soloist, and as he had been virtually brought up
in Florence and the people there had watched his career
with eager interest, his appearance was a real homecoming
and the greeting affectionate in the extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a charming reception given at the house of Albert’s
father after the concert, I met the historian Ferrero and a
delightful acquaintance from previous visits, Mrs. Janet
Ross. She is a daughter of the beautiful Lady Duff-Gordon,
and when she was a child George Meredith had
occupied a cottage on her father’s estate in England. He
had adored her and it was said that she had been his
inspiration for <span class='it'>Rose</span> in “Evan Harrington.” I had met
her in Florence in 1913, when she already was well over
seventy and a woman of remarkable intellectual power
and physical activity. She lives in a delightful old villa
with walls two feet thick on a hill below Fiesole. Boccaccio
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
had written part of his “Decameron” there and
the house was filled with interesting old Italian furniture.
She made her own olive-oil and vermuth on her farm and
sold large quantities of it to England. When I admired
some exquisite dining-room chairs, she told me she had
found them in Pisa and that they were good eighteenth-century
models. She said: “I have a little Italian carpenter
who carves wood very well and if you like I can
have these copied for you and they will cost you very
little.” I have these chairs in my house to-day and value
them doubly as having come to me through the good
offices of this interesting lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had also made a remarkable collection of old
Italian <span class='it'>stornelli</span>, which she had heard through mingling
with the Italian peasants and farmers in Tuscany and
elsewhere and had noted down. As this collection numbers
literally hundreds of folk-songs, many of them dating
back centuries, it should prove valuable to the connoisseur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Parma, the following day, I visited the Teatro Farnese.
It is the oldest theatre in Italy, and while it is in a
somewhat dilapidated condition and, of course, no longer
used for performances, it is fascinating as a relic, and one
can well imagine what splendid pageants and dramatic
cantatas must have been performed there before the
great nobles of that day and their retinue. The Teatro
Regio seemed to me the most beautiful that we had played
in. It seated over two thousand people and we marvelled
that so small a town as Parma should be the proud possessor
of such a home for music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heat was again intense, but as the audience were in
an extremely receptive and tumultuous mood, we did not
mind it, and the orchestra played superbly. I was sorry
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
therefore to have been compelled to nip in the bud a little
plot which I luckily discovered that evening. Sixteen adventurous
young members of the orchestra had very
quietly decided that they would take a midnight train
for Venice, spend a happy day there on its lagoons, with
perhaps even a swim on the Lido, and then take another
night train for Milan, arriving just in time for our concert
there. Milan is an important musical centre, and I did
not wish to play there with an orchestra partly tired out
by two night trips, besides the strong possibility of delayed
Italian trains, which operate on the principle of
<span class='it'>chi va piano, va sano, ma non lontano</span>. I therefore had
to forbid this little excursion, although I sympathized
strongly with our men for wanting to carry it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I arrived in Milan two hours ahead of the orchestra
and was met at the station by a committee consisting of
Signor Finci, the president of the Milan Symphony
Society, under whose auspices we were to play, Campanari,
brother of my old friend the barytone, and honorary
secretary of the Verdi Home for Aged Musicians, the
prefect of the police, and several others. All had pale
and anxious faces, and had come to tell me that there
was not a room to be had in Milan, that several hotels
had closed their doors as there was a restaurant and
waiters’ strike, and that they wanted to consult with me
what had better be done. That mischievous strike devil
evidently was to be a permanent member of our organization
on the entire tour. I retired with the committee
to the room of the prefect at the railroad station and discussed
various plans, although in the back of my mind
was the firm conviction that my men would find rooms,
beds, and food if they were suddenly dumped in the
middle of the desert of Sahara. I finally asked Campanari
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
if there were any spare rooms in the Verdi Home
for Aged Musicians, and he informed me that the entire
home was empty, as they had not been able to operate it
at all during the war, owing to lack of funds. There were
plenty of beds, blankets, and sheets, but no servants of
any kind. This was at least something, and I thought
that my young men would not at all mind sleeping in
beds that were intended for aged musicians and doing
their own chamber work. The prefect also suggested
several empty beds in the city hospital, but this did not
look to me so inviting. However, I finally arranged with
them to meet again at the station on the arrival of the
orchestra and I would put the matter before them, and
then let them go forth and fare for themselves. Any one
who had not found a bed should return to the station and
report at the office of the prefect, who would then see
that some kind of accommodation was found. This plan
was carried out and my manager reported to me that at
the final hour only two of our orchestra reported at the
station, the one to say that he had found no room and
the other that he had two. These two men went off arm
in arm therefore, and my faith in the orchestra was again
abundantly justified, although the hotel strike here was
even worse than in Genoa. I was quartered with my family
at the Continental Hotel and, with the exception of a
few toothless old hags, who made a pretense of taking
care of the rooms, there was no service of any kind. The
principal cause of the strike seems to have been a realization
on the part of hotel employees that it was undignified
for them to accept tips, especially as the tipping
system produced such unequal results, the chambermaid
on the first floor of a hotel receiving often ten times as
much in tips as the one who officiated on the fourth
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>
floor. They therefore demanded that a tax of ten to
fifteen per cent be added to the bills of travellers, this
amount then to be distributed among the employees
according to a certain schedule. In the meantime we
sizzled in the heat and suffered. To add to our discomfort,
there was a great scarcity in the city supply of water,
and if one wanted a bath it could only be obtained at six
o’clock in the morning or after ten at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But again the discipline of the men and the determination
to demonstrate themselves as an artistic organization
manifested itself in a remarkable way, and both of
our concerts were superbly played and enthusiastically
received. We considered Milan one of the most important
cities of our tour. Its opera at the famous La Scala
is world-renowned, and of recent years, especially through
the efforts of Maestro Toscanini, a highly cultivated audience
for symphonic music has developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Toscanini, whom I had known and often admired in
America, was rehearsing and conducting in Padua.
To my surprise and delight he took a night train from
there in order to be present at our Sunday afternoon
concert and to give me a brotherly greeting. After the
concert he accompanied me to the railroad station where
he was to take the night train back to Padua. As we
arrived my orchestra, who were already in their respective
sleeping-cars, recognized him and with a great roar
of welcome gave him three American cheers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our three days in Milan had been very busy ones. On
Friday afternoon the Ricordi Music Publishing Company
gave us a reception, showing the orchestra through their
enormous printing works. The first concert was given
that evening. On Saturday the mayor and commune of
Milan gave us a reception with a visit to the City Museum
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
at the Castello Sforzesco. This was followed by a concert
given for us by the excellent municipal band in the
courtyard, and a “tea” which consisted of all manner of
sandwiches, ices, cakes, and, above all, innumerable bottles
of champagne. We were all glad that there was no
concert that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the Sunday concert a number of motor-buses
took the orchestra and musical instruments quickly to
the station, while our Italian friends stood around and
marvelled at what they called “American efficiency,”
and we rolled out of Milan and Italy on our way to
Strassbourg, exceedingly tired, but with a feeling that
we had brought Italy and America many steps nearer to
each other by our visit. We had been simply overwhelmed
with demonstrations of affection from the moment
we arrived in Italy, and there is something in the
almost childlike manner in which the Italians demonstrate
their feelings that endeared them very quickly to us. They
are seething with vitality, and the very intensity of their
emotions, which to the cooler North American temperament
sometimes seems exaggerated, is a force to be reckoned
with in the future of the world. While their civilization
is the oldest in Europe they seem to be the youngest
people of to-day, and in my profession and the kindred
arts I expect great things from the Italian people as soon
as the dreadful aftermath of the World War shall have
been cleared away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was much interested in Strassbourg and Metz in the
curious mixture of German and French civilization. In
Strassbourg we were very cordially received by the new
director of the Conservatory, M. Ropartz, of Nancy, one
of France’s most distinguished musicians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Metz the mayor made a speech of welcome and with
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
a group of citizens gave us a “vin d’honneur” after the
concert. Both cities gave us audiences evidently accustomed
to concerts of symphonic music and with a fine
appreciation of what we would offer them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the public square in Strassbourg I noticed a group
of citizens excitedly pointing toward a steeple on the opposite
side and, lo and behold, I saw a stork, the first one
to get back from his winter sojourn in Africa to spend the
summer in his native haunts. The reader will wonder
that I have not something more exciting to relate, but I
confess that the complete freedom from the official and
social engagements after our hectic weeks in Italy came
like a heavenly balm, not to mention the agreeable change
of living again in a hotel with real waiters, chambermaids,
and cooks to minister to one’s comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at that stork and suddenly an old doggerel
jumped into my head that I had sung with other children
over fifty years before, and which begins:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Storch, Storch, Steiner, mit de langen Beiner”—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and here was perhaps a descendant of the very bird
whom we had greeted so long ago. I was inclined to
become sentimental over this interesting possibility, but
the stork flew away without showing any reciprocal interest
and my mood did not last long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We returned to Paris the following day, and on the
morning of June 4 started in a special train to Fontainebleau,
where the entire orchestra were to be guests of the
mayor and municipality for the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestions which I had made to Francis Casadesus
in Paris and Chaumont during our long talks in
1918, while he and I were examining the two hundred
bandmasters of the A. E. F., had borne quick fruits.
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
Casadesus had communicated my suggestion of a summer
school for American musicians to his very musical friend,
M. Fragnaud, the sous-préfet of Fontainebleau. He in
turn had interested M. Bonnet, the mayor, and in consequence
a quick decision had been reached that the summer
school should be placed at Fontainebleau and housed
in an entire wing of the historic Palais de Fontainebleau,
which would be donated for this purpose by the French
Government. I was delighted at this happy outcome,
and, as the people concerned evidently wished to signalize
it by some special fête, I gladly accepted their invitation
to give a concert there with our orchestra and
make this, so to speak, the beginning of relations which
will, I hope, help materially to bring France and America
musically closer together for many years to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many French musicians and dignitaries were on the
train to take part in the day’s celebration. There were
M. Paul Leon, representing the Ministère des Beaux Arts;
Alfred Cortot, distinguished pianist; Mangeot, editor of
the <span class='it'>Monde Musicale</span> and founder of the École Normale de
Musique in Paris; Francis and Henri Casadesus, Mlle.
Boulanger, Albert Bruneau, composer of the opera “Le
Rêve”; M. Dumesnil, deputy for Fontainebleau, and
many others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole town had been declared “en fête.” Every
shop was closed and French and American flags, gaily
intertwined, festooned all the principal streets. The
street leading to the Mairie was lined on both sides by
French troops, and we all tried to look as if we were delegates
to the Versailles Conference as we marched to the
reception of the mayor, and looked at this martial array.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The luncheon which followed was one of those typical
French affairs in which the gay was charmingly mingled
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
with the more serious and ceremonial. M. Dumesnil
proved himself one of the greatest orators I have ever
heard and played upon every emotion of the human
heart, evoking tears and laughter with the voice and
diction of a virtuoso.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was succeeded by M. Bruneau arising and suddenly
addressing me, and at the close pinning the Legion
d’Honneur on my coat, after which, to the huge delight of
my orchestra, he, in true French fashion, kissed me on both
cheeks. It is very agreeable to have one’s orchestra present
while such honors are conferred, as their approval demonstrates
itself in most noisy fashion, and my boys know
that this particular decoration is as much theirs as mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As there was no theatre in Fontainebleau large enough
to hold the huge audience, the concert was given in the
Ménage d’Artillerie, which had been hastily converted into
a concert hall. It proved excellent for this purpose, except
that as soon as we began playing, hundreds of birds,
which had had undisturbed possession of the rafters and
of the musical privileges of this building for years, were
evidently disturbed and angered by our intrusion. They
suddenly flew out from their nests and burst into shrill
songs of protest, which mingled, not without interesting
results, with the harmonies of the “New World Symphony,”
played by special request of the sous-préfet, M.
Fragnaud, who is himself an excellent amateur oboe player.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the front rows of the audience were hundreds of
school-children who had been dressed “en Américaine,”
with enormous bows and sashes composed of the American
stars and stripes. That there were several hundred of
these I can testify, as I had to shake hands with every
one of them after the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
The following day, before leaving for Belgium, I received
the welcome news that a rather disagreeable matter
concerning our three concerts at the Paris Opéra had
been most amicably settled. The Opera House, which is
the property of the French Government, had been offered
to us by the Ministère des Beaux Arts “free of rent,” but
we were to pay for the actual expenses of light, heat, and
service incurred. When I first arrived in Paris our local
manager informed us that the Director of the Opera, who
holds a lease of the building, intended to charge us thirty
thousand francs for his “expenses.” This seemed to me
excessive, and I remonstrated with M. Leon, the Director
of the Beaux Arts. The Director of the Opera, who had
lost millions of francs at the opera during the war, was a
man of wealth to whom the opera was more or less of a
personal toy, but he evidently wished to recoup somewhat
on us, for he argued that, inasmuch as he might have
given opera performances on the days and hours when we
had our concerts, we should be charged with the pro-rata
expense of his singers, orchestra, chorus, and ballet. This
argument, however, did not seem valid to us, as since time
immemorial there had never been any opera performances
on those days of the week. I presented our case to M.
Leon and told him that as I had never had any dealing
or arrangement with the Director of the Opera but only
with the Ministère des Beaux Arts, I was compelled to
leave the matter entirely in their hands. We were their
guests, and if they felt that we should pay thirty thousand
francs for “expenses” we would most certainly do so.
The results were most satisfactory, but not entirely unexpected
by me, and the sum which we finally paid was a
perfectly fair amount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went to Brussels on June 3 by motor, through a great
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>
part of the devastated regions and all the horror and misery
of destroyed villages, field after field pock-marked by
shell explosions and dreary remains of a few stumps of
trees where had been acres and acres of forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On our arrival we were welcomed with open arms by
our ambassador, Brand Whitlock, and his wife. He told
me that but two weeks before he had been suddenly informed
that we could not play at the Théâtre Royal de la
Monnaie because a socialist organization of Brussels
claimed the right to it for an entertainment of their own.
There had been a mix-up because the director of the opera,
who had promised us the theatre, had died and the new
incumbent claimed to have no knowledge of our coming.
They intended to place us in a Flemish theatre, which of
course did not have the dignity of the Royal Opera House,
and Mr. Whitlock promptly told them that, as we were
there by invitation of the Belgian Government and as our
coming had an international significance, he could not
permit us to be euchred out of our rightful possession of
the Théâtre de la Monnaie, and if we could not have
that he would telegraph to me urging us to cancel the
concert. This evidently produced results. The socialist
organization was appealed to, and immediately and
courteously said that it would do anything for an American
orchestra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same lack of what we would call proper management
of concerts seemed to exist in Brussels as in many
cities of France and Italy. Large advertisements, such
as fill the amusement columns of American papers, are
hardly ever used. Two lines inserted only once or twice
are the rule. Reading notices, giving the programme or
other information regarding the concert, are printed only
if paid for at so much a line. Small posters, which are
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
pasted on street corners for a week or two, are almost the
only advertising indulged in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Transfer companies—such as in our country meet a
musical or theatrical organization at the station with a
specified number of trucks to carry the musical baggage
or scenery to the theatre—are not known. We had put
this important part of our tour into the hands of Thomas
Cook and Sons, and their representative, on the arrival
of the train, would negotiate with this or that driver
lounging around the station and lazily looking for jobs. In
Italy the porters again and again simply refused to transport
our stuff because the weather was too hot, and they
would only begin at six or seven o’clock in the evening,
when thirty little handcarts, pushed by as many men,
would carry the musical instruments to the theatre.
Luckily concerts in Italy begin at nine or nine-thirty, so
we always managed in one way or another to get our instruments
transported. Several times, however, even
soldiers and military camions were bribed into service.
This slovenliness, which is maddening to an American, is
so universal in Europe, especially since the war, that one
marvels how anything can be accomplished; and yet with
the exception of places where strikes interfered we got
along, even though we were sometimes wild with anxiety
and foolishly furious at what we considered to be their
national characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody in Belgium, however, seems to read the
posters, for the demand for seats in Brussels was so great
that we could have filled the little opera-house twice over.
Its acoustics are marvellous, and the strings vibrate like
an old Cremona violin. They had specially requested
that the concert should be purely symphonic and without
any soloist. I therefore gave them the lovely Mozart
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
“Jupiter” Symphony and the César Franck D Minor.
Franck had been born in Liège, and I wished to demonstrate
to them our love and understanding of this noble
musician. I do not think I have ever played before an
audience more sensitive to the beauties of music. As a
special compliment to Brussels we played an Adagio for
strings by Lekeu, a modern, highly talented, young Belgian
composer, who unfortunately had died at the age of
twenty-four. The Adagio is a work of tender, melancholy
beauty, and sounded so exquisite in this building that
the players and I were intensely moved by it during the
performance. This emotion was evidently communicated
to the audience, so that at the close their applause could
not be quieted, and I finally had to take the score of the
composition from my desk and point to it in silent pantomime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the concert, as I was preparing to leave the theatre,
two ladies came toward me with an old man who
proved to be the father of Guillaume Lekeu. He tried to
thank me for our playing of his son’s composition, but
broke down completely as the tears poured down his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following day at Antwerp I saw again to my great
delight the famous old tenor, Van Dyk, with whom I had
given many a Wagner opera during our engagement at
the Metropolitan with the Maurice Grau Opera Company.
His villa, near Antwerp, had been occupied by a
German general and his staff during the four years of the
war. They had drunk up his entire wine-cellar, consisting
of many hundred bottles of choice vintages, and had
also removed every bit of copper from his door-knobs
and kitchen. Otherwise they had left his house intact,
and, with imperturbable good humor and courage, Van
Dyk had taken up again the work of gaining an existence
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
for his family. Twice a week he went to Brussels, where
he had an interesting class in dramatic singing at the
Royal Conservatory, and besides this he was busily engaged
as a director of an insurance company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Antwerp, as well as in Liège and Ghent, we found
the same discriminating and educated audiences as in
Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly anywhere did we see the ravages of war, and
what little there were were being quickly repaired by the
industrious inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left Belgium on June 10, to enter Holland, playing at
The Hague that evening and in Amsterdam the day after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Holland our American diplomatic representative,
William Phillips, Minister to The Hague, had been active
in assuring us a welcome. He was an old friend and had
invited not only the Queen Mother, who is the only
musical member of the royal household, but a distinguished
party of nearly one hundred, including all the
diplomatic representatives and the highest officials of the
court and governments, to be his guests at the concert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first part he introduced me to the Queen
Mother, who proved to be very charming and much interested
in music, and who also possessed that delightful
royal quality of putting you “at your ease.” This consists
in asking a question and then not waiting for you to
answer, but answering it in all its possibilities and bearings
herself. Conversation is thus made rather one-sided
but agreeable, even though all the brilliant things one
might have said remain unuttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the concert the entire distinguished party assembled
at the legation for a delicious supper, at which I
met a great many charming Dutch ladies who, fortunately
for me, spoke English or French.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
The next day Mr. Phillips motored me to Amsterdam.
There the members of the local orchestra immediately
poured into the willing ears of my men dreadful stories of
local jealousy of our coming, that several of the newspapers
had been told to criticise us severely, and that all
the adherents of the local orchestra had ostentatiously
decided to absent themselves from our concert. Very
little of this proved to be true. The huge hall in which
we played, the Concertgebow, has a stage perched up so
high that the people in the parquet literally have to
strain their necks to see the performers, and the reverberation
of sound is excessive. The hall seats three thousand
people, and there were not more than fourteen hundred
at our concert. However, they certainly made up in enthusiasm
what they lacked in numbers. All previous
notions of the phlegm of the Dutch people were completely
dissipated. Not being a prima donna, I did not
keep count of the many times I was recalled after the
“Eroica” Symphony, but, as I had to march down and
up a platform of about fifty steps each time, the exercise
in connection with it was considerable. The newspapers
next morning, in spite of all the dark rumors, were enthusiastic
in our praise and generous in their comparison
of our orchestra with their own splendid organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>London marked the last lap of our musical race through
Europe. We stayed a week and gave five concerts, four
at Queens’ Hall on June 14, 15, 16, and 19, and one on
June 20 at the huge Royal Albert Hall. The lucky star
which had accompanied us during the entire tour shone
for us with steadfast light during this last week. The
orchestra never played better and the newspapers heartily
echoed the reception we received from the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not conducted in London since a concert mentioned
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
elsewhere in these reminiscences, given at Princes’
Hall by Ovide Musin in 1888, when I was but twenty-six
years of age. Since then great changes have come over
the musical life of England. At that time music was to a
great extent in the hands of foreigners, and one has only
to see the old pictures by Du Maurier in <span class='it'>Punch</span> to realize
that the musician in English drawing-rooms was generally
a long-haired German or Italian. Hans Richter was the
great popular conductor in London and there were many
foreigners in the British orchestras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since then the Anglicization of music had been going
on rapidly, thanks principally to great music-schools
such as the Royal College of Music, under Sir Charles
Villiers Stanford and Sir Hugh Allen, and the Royal
Academy of Music, under Sir Alexander MacKenzie.
These schools educate great numbers of orchestral musicians,
and to-day the personnel of British orchestras is
composed almost entirely of native-born. Many of us
consider Sir Edward Elgar the greatest symphonic composer
since Brahms, and his education has been altogether
British. A group of English conductors, of whom
Sir Henry Wood is the dean and Albert Coates and Eugene
Goosens among the most gifted, have made for themselves
an international reputation. England has now the
material for a strong national musical life. With such
conductors as she possesses and her splendid orchestral
material, her orchestras would soon rival those of America
if her citizens would give them the same generous
support which our organizations receive, but in this respect
the condition of London is very much what it
was in New York preceding and during the first half of
my career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her orchestras are to a great extent co-operative. The
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
concerts are projected and given by the members of the
orchestra and they divide the profits among themselves.
These profits are exceedingly small and do not really pay
them for the time given to the rehearsals and concerts.
The London Symphony, for instance, gives only eight
concerts during the winter, and rarely has more than three
rehearsals to a concert. In consequence of this, while the
players have developed a great facility in reading at sight
and making the most of the limited rehearsal time, the
results cannot be as finely worked out as is possible in the
generously endowed orchestras of America, which assemble
their players every morning for rehearsal and give
more than one hundred symphonic concerts during a
winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We lay great stress on unanimity of bowing, for proper
phrasing can only be secured if the sixteen first violins,
for instance, who have to play a phrase in unison, play
as one. To the educated ear there is a great difference
in the effect if one or two or more notes are played on
the same bow or if a phrase is begun with an up or a down
bow. Generally speaking, this unanimity in our playing
impressed and delighted our London audiences and critics,
but one of the latter was evidently annoyed by it as he
began his analysis of our concert with the head-line: “Orchestra
Too Perfect to be Good.” His eye had evidently
been accustomed to the more “free and easy” bowing at
some of their own concerts, and he thought that a more
emotionally inspired effect was produced if the individual
member of the orchestra is not restricted by too much
discipline. It must be acknowledged, however, that a
good conductor must guard himself from the temptation
to make a god out of technic, which should, after all, be
merely a means to an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>
Because of our undoubted superiority in orchestras and
opera we cannot, however, claim to be a more musical
people than the British. Their love and cultivation of
choral music is far greater than ours and they have a
small group of composers whose work is more important
and interesting than the aggregate we can as yet produce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Augustus Littleton and his friends arranged many affairs
for our pleasure, among them a ceremonial luncheon
at the Mansion House by the Lord Mayor of London.
This luncheon was attended also by the American ambassador,
Mr. Davis, Viscount Bryce, and many of the
foremost English musicians. My orchestra was hugely
delighted and impressed with the quaint mediæval ceremonies,
the gorgeous uniforms and liveries, and the prodigal
hospitality displayed by our kind host. As a mark
of special friendliness toward the New York Symphony
Orchestra and its first visit to Great Britain I was made a
member of the “Worshipfull Company of Musicians,”
founded by James I in 1604, and was presented with the
silver medal of that ancient organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our ambassador proved himself just as able to discourse
eloquently on the importance of music as on any other
theme which might tend to strengthen cultural bonds between
the two nations. Both he and his wife had evidently
endeared themselves to the English people, and
many were the regrets when, with the change of party in
Washington, he tendered his resignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the luncheon Lord Bryce beamed his approval
of the proceedings, as he had given nearly all of
his energies during the later years of his life toward a
better understanding between the two English-speaking
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The orchestra sailed for America on the <span class='it'>Olympic</span> on
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>
the Tuesday following our last concert, and I bade them
good-by with my heart in my mouth; they had done
such honor to our president, Mr. Flagler, to our country,
and to their conductor. During the entire tour of seven
weeks there had not been one lapse from perfect discipline,
a discipline largely self-imposed. Each one had
felt his responsibility and had acted accordingly. Their
playing had been at high-water mark continually and
they had borne the inevitable fatigues and annoyances of
constant travel with unfailing good humor. On the other
hand, their delights had been many. They had seen the
great art treasures and scenic beauties of five countries,
and with that quick perception which is one of the characteristics
of American life, they had taken full advantage
of their opportunities. If they gave of their best with
both hands, Europe certainly returned with equal prodigality,
and there is not one of my men who would not
jump at the chance to repeat our experiences at the first
opportunity, naturally still further extending the tour to
include Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czecho-Slovakia.
We are still somewhat shy of Russia, however, as the reports
which my Russian musicians get from their former
country are too dismal and uninviting.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span><h1>XVII</h1></div>

<h3>WOMEN IN MUSICAL AFFAIRS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe music sprang from the ground and it is the
folk-songs and folk-dances of the peasant that have
gradually—refined and developed in the hands of the
great composers—worked their way upward and become
the possession and delight of the cultured classes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this country we have no peasantry, and what slight
remains of folk-songs and folk-dances we possess, apart
from the music of the negro, have only recently been
dug out of the isolated mountain fastnesses of Kentucky
and Tennessee. These are generally of British origin
and cannot be considered as having been part and parcel
of our national life. As against the rich subsoil of the
folk-songs of Germany, Bohemia, Russia, France, and
Scotland we can show but the thinnest artificial layer of
music, and this has been created and carefully nurtured
by a small educated class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dreary social life of the early Puritan settlers and
their frowning attitude toward the joys of life further retarded
the growth of the arts among us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think there has ever been a country whose
musical development has been fostered so almost exclusively
by women as America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Musical education began among the well-to-do classes
who could afford to engage the European musicians who
immigrated to America to teach their daughters—but
not, alas, their sons. A strong feeling existed that music
was essentially an effeminate art, and that its cultivation
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
by a man took away that much from his manliness
and, above all, made him unfit to worship at the most
sacred shrine of business. I am speaking now of fifty
years ago. Conditions have improved since that time,
but not sufficiently as yet to produce normal and healthy
conditions regarding the civilization of our people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women’s musical clubs began to form in many a village,
town, and city, and these clubs became the active
and efficient nucleus of the entire musical life of the
community, but, alas, again principally the feminine
community. It is to these women’s clubs that the managers
turn for fat guarantees for appearances of their
artists, and it is before audiences of whom seventy-five
per cent are women that these artists disport themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this has been that the cultural life of
American women has often been absolutely a thing apart
from their relations with their men-folk. It has become
accepted that of course men do not and need not share
the women’s interest in the arts; and while business does
not perhaps monopolize the American man in quite as
unhealthy a fashion as in former years, the principal
change which has been brought about is the introduction
of golf, at least an occupation in which men and women
may share. What a pity that the elusive ball is not composed
of a little Beethoven and Brahms instead of the
mysterious mixture of concrete and gutta-percha, and
that family life, which is the very fortress of civilization,
cannot make use of the cultivation of music as one of the
strongest ties to bind husband and wife, sons and daughters
together!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of us are too prone to look upon modern plumbing,
telephones, and motor-cars as evidences of high
civilization or even culture, when they are really only
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>
more or less agreeable conveniences which minister to our
comfort but not to our heart or head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe men and women share more equally in the
love and cultivation of music, and the emotional and personal
attitude of the women is offset by the more impersonal
and mental attitude of the men. The result of this
is shown in audiences in which neither sex predominates
and, above all, in the cultivation of chamber-music at
home in which professionals and amateurs, men and
women, participate to their mutual pleasure and development.
Nothing more charming can be imagined than such
family evenings of music, during which the players indulge
themselves in the string quartets and piano trios
of Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms, with perhaps a small
audience of enthusiasts composed of other members of
the family and half a dozen friends who afterward all
join in a jolly supper of bread and cold meats, together
with a good bottle of wine or beer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My father carried this lovely custom into the New
World, and I owe almost my entire education in chamber-music
to the Sunday afternoons at his house, the tranquil
and spiritual atmosphere of which is unforgettable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years ago a meeting was held in the mayor’s
office at City Hall at which I had been asked to speak
in behalf of good music for the people on Sunday afternoons
and evenings. A clergyman from Brooklyn had
made a tremendous appeal against any Sunday recreations
and wanted the aldermen to revive the old blue
laws of two hundred years ago. The room was crowded
with people, and when I spoke of what the chamber-music
on Sunday afternoons at my father’s house had meant
to me as a boy, this audience broke into such enthusiastic
applause that there was no mistaking the general attitude,
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>
and my Sunday symphony concerts, which I was
the first to inaugurate in New York, have only once been
interfered with by municipal authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some American women have realized the false and one-sided
condition of musical culture in our country and have
sought to remedy it by encouraging their sons to take up
the study of some musical instrument, but it has been up-hill
work, as the general sentiment of the country has not
yet been sufficiently awakened. Plato considered the
study and appreciation of music an educational necessity
for the young Athenian, but such schools as Groton,
Saint Paul’s, and Saint Mark’s, for instance, have not yet
admitted music to their regular curriculum, and in so far
as it is studied there it is considered rather an outside
privilege with which the school course has no official
connection. Among the boys the necessity for excelling
in football or baseball is so carefully and consistently insisted
upon that almost the entire time left from school
hours is devoted to these sports, and the boy who wants
to continue the study of a musical instrument, which a
fond mother has perhaps begun with him before he entered
the school, is looked upon by the other boys as a
sissy. The standard of personal conduct set in these
schools is high, but the tendency seems to be to make
the boys as like each other as possible. Many of them, if
not discouraged, would develop decided artistic talent,
but individuality and independence of thinking, which
should be the end and aim of all teaching, is often frowned
upon, and the results only contribute still further to the
monotony of our social life, in which the courage to be
one’s self is submerged in the desire to be exactly like
every one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The public schools of our country, however, show a
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
much more intelligent attitude than formerly; and, while
the time allowed for singing and the study of the beginnings
of music is still all too short, music is taught to the
boys as well as to the girls. The singing of the children
has greatly improved, and in many cities school orchestras
have been formed, which the boys and girls enjoy
immensely and in many of which music of good character
is studied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Los Angeles and Berkeley, California, I heard some
excellent school orchestras, and in Dayton, Ohio, Mrs.
Talbot has interested herself personally in this movement
with great enthusiasm and excellent results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In New York, my brother Frank, while supervisor of
music in the public schools, effected a complete reform in
the teaching of the children and succeeded in interesting
the authorities to give music a more important position.
The singing improved immensely and since his retirement
Mr. Gartlan, his successor, has continued the good work.
I have several times used choruses of a thousand school
children at the music festivals of the Oratorio Society
in the production of such works as Pierné’s exquisite “The
Crusade of the Children” and “The Children of Bethlehem,”
and the children sang the three-part harmonies of
their music with such purity and exquisite quality of tone
as to bring happy tears to the eyes of the audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>School orchestras have been formed all over the city,
and once a year I take my entire orchestra to one of the
large auditoriums of the public high schools and for two
thousand little would-be orchestra musicians we play a
programme composed of the music they have been studying
during the winter. We never play before a more enthusiastic
and delightful audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirty-one years ago I gave the first orchestral concert
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
for children, and twenty-five years ago my brother Frank
founded the Young People’s Symphony Concerts, which
were designed to introduce the beauties of orchestral
music to children, and in a short explanatory talk to
unravel its mysteries of construction and demonstrate
the tone colors of the different instruments of the orchestra.
These concerts have proved an enormous success
and of great importance for the education of the
coming generation. When my brother retired from
public work in order to devote himself exclusively to the
direction of the Institute of Musical Art I took over these
concerts, and have since added another course intended
exclusively for little children from seven to twelve years
of age. The audiences are truly remarkable. The faces
of the children are aglow with interest and excitement,
and when I sit down at the piano after playing an overture
with the orchestra and, repeating some melodic phrase
from it, ask them, “Which instrument played this melody?”
their little voices ring out from all over the hall in
high, shrill accents, like little pistol-shots, “The oboe!
The oboe! The trumpet!” Then I let all those who
think it was the oboe raise their hands, and if they are
right great is their triumph, and if they are wrong equally
great is their chagrin. Generally they are right!</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my orchestral tours I have several times given such
children’s concerts on the afternoon preceding the regular
evening symphony, and while two such concerts in one
day are a great exertion, the children’s especially demanding
a great output of vitality in order to keep their
interest, I have felt more than repaid by the results; in
many of the cities my work in this direction has been
continued by the local orchestras or musical clubs (again
the women!), and with the happiest results.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
In New York also women devoted to music have greatly
contributed toward its development, but occasionally the
result of their efforts has not been so beneficial. Not so
long ago a handsome but incompetent foreign musician
(I will not disclose any name or dates in this story) came
to New York and enlisted the sympathies of a few enthusiastic
women. As many women need some personality on
which to centre their devotion to art, they decided that
New York should have this particular gentleman to direct
its symphonic future. The American business man
is proverbially good-natured to his womenkind and ready
to pour out money for music provided he is not compelled
to listen to it, and so these ladies gathered a huge
fund with which to give a series of orchestral concerts.
The amount was large enough to maintain a good symphony
orchestra in proper hands for an entire winter,
but in this instance was to be expended on six concerts
only. The handsome young foreigner gave his first concert,
which was a failure so complete and dismal—he
being not only without any reputation but with hardly
any experience in work of this kind—that even his little
group of adorers became appalled and proposed to cancel
the rest of the concerts. One lady, however, who had
her own special favorite conductor, suggested that a complete
disgrace might be averted if her protégé were invited
to conduct the remaining concerts. As he was an
excellent artist and thoroughly routined in the handling
of orchestral players the results were so good and, above
all, such a contrast to the dire tragedy of the first concert
that the enthusiastic lady devotee saw her opportunity
and suggested that a new orchestra should be formed
for the following winter, the concerts of which should be
conducted by the man who had saved the situation for
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
them. New York had already an average during the winter
of a hundred and fifty symphonic concerts by the New
York Philharmonic, the New York Symphony, the Boston
Symphony, and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and it
would seem from this that the symphonic needs of our
public were already more than amply supplied; but an enthusiastic
woman, especially when driven by devotion for
some pet artist, refuses to recognize practical conditions,
and so this little group proceeded to gather more funds,
amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars, in order
to put the new orchestra properly on its feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their first difficulty was to find good players. There
are never very many first-class symphonic players to be
found. Not only do the two old-established New York
orchestras employ about a hundred players each, but the
orchestras of other cities come to New York to fill their
vacancies. For years the Philharmonic, the New York
Symphony, and other out-of-town orchestras had a gentleman’s
agreement that they would not steal each other’s
players, but this new organization immediately proceeded
to take thirty-seven from the Philharmonic by
offering them immensely higher salaries. They did not
take a single player from the New York Symphony Orchestra
because, as they vowed, of their great personal
respect for me, but I think it was partly because we happened
to have a two-year contract with all our men
which bound them to us very effectively for another
season. They filled their ranks further from members
of the Boston Orchestra and from other out-of-town organizations,
and then proceeded on their first regular
season as a New York Orchestra with loud protestations
that New York at last had an organization worthy of the
metropolis. This orchestra carried on its existence for
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
two years, at the end of which it came to a dismal close
with an expenditure for the three seasons over and above
the receipts of the box-office of nearly a million dollars,
which their surprised and chagrined men guarantors had
to pay. This is but one of several such irregular ventures,
each one of which has swallowed hundreds of thousands.
One would think that the inevitable failure of these efforts
would deter others from undertaking them, but such
is not the case. Hope springs eternal in the breast of the
musical woman devotee and I have just heard of a new
orchestra now being formed in order to enable still another
foreigner, whose interpretations will of course be a
revelation to our public, to wield his stick in this country
as his own has refused to accept him at his own valuation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In recent years chamber-music in New York has received
great encouragement and intelligent support from
women. Mrs. Frederick S. Coolidge has proved a veritable
godmother to this lovely branch of musical art, and
every fall the festivals of chamber-music which she gives in
Pittsfield in the Berkshire Hills bring together notable
gatherings of musicians and music lovers as her guests.
For several years she has offered generous prizes in competition
for various forms of chamber-music. But to me the
most encouraging thing that she has done is the commissioning
of certain composers to write compositions for
these festivals. Neither string quartets nor violin sonatas
can ever become profitable to the composer in the ordinary
way of commerce, as the number of copies which can be
sold of such works is necessarily limited. Even young
American composers must live, and if they are to devote
their time to the creation of serious forms of art they
should be assured of at least some financial recompense
for the time they must give to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>
Mrs. Ralph Pulitzer has entirely maintained an excellent
string quartet for the past three years, and I should
like to see such excellent examples followed by others
among our well-to-do, as chamber-music is essentially
written for performance in the home and loses much of
its charm and intimacy if given in a larger hall and before
hundreds of people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time to come the initiative for a more general
musical education of our people will have to come
from the women. If American mothers will demand and
obtain for their sons the same musical privileges and opportunities
which their daughters now enjoy America
will speedily become the most musical country in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much has already been done, but much remains, and
I should like to live a hundred years longer just to watch
this development and to rejoice in its results.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span><h1>XVIII</h1></div>

<h3>BOSTON</h3>

<p class='pindent'>In 1887 I visited Boston for the first time professionally.
I had begun my Wagnerian lecture recitals in New
York a year or two before, and they had spread like wildfire
in all directions. The enthusiasm for Wagner, which
had been kindled into a bright flame by my father’s
founding of German opera at the Metropolitan Opera
House, had produced a wide-spread desire for better acquaintance
with Wagner’s music and his theories regarding
the music-drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I received an invitation from a group of Boston women,
including Mrs. John L. Gardner, Mrs. O. B. Frothingham,
Mrs. George Tyson, and Mrs. Henry Whitman, to
give my lecture recitals on the “Nibelungen Trilogy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Boston at that time occupied a unique position as
the only city in America which possessed a permanent
orchestra, maintained by Major Henry Lee Higginson,
for the cultivation of symphonic music. A small group
of highly educated and socially prominent Bostonians,
belonging to the oldest New England families, made this
orchestra almost the focus of their social life. The
weekly concerts were the great events, the programmes
eagerly discussed, and its conductor, Wilhelm Gericke, was
alternately cursed or blessed according to their attitude
toward some novelty which he had just produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among this group I was made heartily welcome. The
atmosphere was intensely local, if not provincial, and as
against the searching, feverish life of a great metropolis
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>
like New York, with its many conflicting interests and
racial currents, the tranquillity and purely American
quality of Boston life, as it presented itself to me, was a
complete contrast. I am speaking of Boston of thirty-five
years ago and of conditions that have to a certain extent
disappeared, for to-day even the young descendants of the
New Englanders of that era seem to find their pleasures
in different and more restless fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the group of which I have spoken, Mrs. Gardner was
among the most original and fascinating. She was certainly
the leaven in the Boston lump and sometimes
shocked the more staid element by her innovations and
interest in more modern currents in art and literature
than had hitherto rippled its calm Emersonian surface.
Boston was at that time perhaps the best example of that
typically American musical culture of which I have spoken
elsewhere, which instead of growing upward from the
masses was carefully introduced and nurtured by an aristocratic
and cultivated community through symphony
concerts and lectures on music. Its original impulse
sprang perhaps more from the head than the heart, but
it would not be fair therefore to say that New Englanders
approached music only from the intellectual standpoint.
I have seen very emotional outbursts among Boston
audiences, both at my Wagner recitals and years after
when I returned with the Damrosch Opera Company
to give the Wagner music-dramas. While it is possible
that they felt heartily ashamed of these enthusiasms afterward,
and exclaimed, “Is this Boston?” the fact remains
that even a Bostonian is human, like other Americans,
and needs only to be encouraged to prove that he
too has a heart which can beat warmly and respond to the
emotions kindled by art.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
Their capacity for friendship in the finest sense of the
word is wonderful, and I achieved many of my dearest
friends at that time. We have all grown much older since
then, with the exception of Mrs. Gardner, on whom the
years leave no imprint and whose enthusiasms for life
and art flame just as brightly to-day as then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was certainly very young in those days, and remember,
after one of my lectures, which had gone off with great
enthusiasm, walking along Boylston Street toward my
hotel, thinking in my young conceit that I was evidently
a good deal of a personage, when I saw that the street
was filled with crowds of people and the police were
making a passage with difficulty so as to allow an open
carriage, drawn by two horses, to pass through. In it
sat a rather stout, smooth-shaven gentleman with a very
shiny high silk hat, and the people were cheering him
like mad. “Who is this?” I asked a bystander. He gave
me a contemptuous look and stopped cheering just long
enough to say: “Don’t you know John L. Sullivan when
you see him?” I accepted the rebuke meekly and entered
my hotel a much more modest man than I had left it a
few hours before. John L. Sullivan, “Boston’s greatest
citizen,” had just come home from a fight in London, but
I do not know to this day whether he had won or lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Boston orchestra was at that time conducted by
Wilhelm Gericke, who had brought it to a remarkable
state of proficiency. I found him to be a very likable
man, a thorough musician, and always gentle and friendly
in his attitude. I used to envy him because, while I had
to maintain my orchestra at that time by my own exertions,
he had a great philanthropist behind him. His orchestra
was engaged by the year, played under no other
conductor, and assembled every morning at 9.30, like
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
clockwork, for rehearsal. Gericke brought the orchestra
up to a high standard of virtuosity. His sense of
values was absolute, and under his training and greatly
assisted by Franz Kneisel, his concert master, the strings
soon acquired great unanimity and a ravishing quality of
tone. His readings were always musicianly, although I
felt occasionally that they were too reserved. He had a
horror of the exaggeration of the brass instruments, and
perhaps erred on the other side in subduing them too
much; but when he returned, years after, for another five
years in Boston his readings had gained in freedom and
elasticity, and the balance of the different choirs seemed
perfectly adjusted. Boston, and indeed the country,
owes him much. He was fortunate in his opportunities,
but he proved himself worthy of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rightly or wrongly, Major Higginson had made it his
rule to engage none but German conductors for his orchestra.
He had gained his first enthusiasm for symphonic
music as a young man in Vienna, and had got the
idea firmly in his mind that only Germany could give his
orchestra the leaders which it required. Among the long
line of conductors who came and went, not all, naturally,
were of equal worth. A few were distinctly second-raters,
and I remember one whose blustering incompetence and
conceit finally so enraged Major Higginson that, as the
gentleman would not resign when requested because his
contract still had another year to run, Higginson sent
him a check for the entire amount and dismissed him.
Curiously enough the impetus which the reputation of
having been conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra
gave was so great that it landed him in two other
American orchestras, one of which he brought to the
very verge of ruin and the other he ruined altogether, so
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>
that the city which had founded it and lavished hundreds
of thousands upon it is now without any symphony orchestra
and seems to have lost the courage to begin
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But among the conductors of the Boston Orchestra
two stand out as among the best that Europe has sent
over. These are Arthur Nikisch and Doctor Karl Muck.
The one died last winter, beloved and mourned by the
musical public of all Europe and of North and South
America; the other was sent from our country back to
Germany after the war in deserved disgrace, after having
been interned as prisoner of war at Fort Oglethorpe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first met Arthur Nikisch in 1887 he was conductor
at the Leipsig Opera House. I had gone there to
attend an annual meeting and festival of the Tonkünstler-Verein,
an association of which Franz Liszt had always
been the president and which had originally been formed
by a small group of Liszt-Wagner-Berlioz adherents, of
whom my father was one. One of the features of the
festival was a stage performance of Berlioz’s “Benvenuto
Cellini,” given in honor of Liszt. The work fascinated
me, and its performance under the young Nikisch delighted
me beyond words. In appearance he already
had the same characteristics which his enemies decried
but which among his friends only aroused a delighted
chuckle when he appeared on the platform, and which
quickly changed to a hurricane of enthusiasm after he had
demonstrated his marvellous skill as an interpreter. I
refer to the long black lock which always hung low over
his forehead and his still longer white cuffs which more
and more enveloped his little white hands as the performance
progressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gericke had developed the orchestra into a perfect instrument,
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
and when Nikisch arrived he played upon it
like a virtuoso. I have always maintained that Nikisch
achieved still greater mastery during his years in America,
because until then he had had no such orchestra at his
disposal. The much-vaunted Leipsig Gewandhaus and
the Berlin Philharmonic, which he conducted, suffer from
the troubles common to all co-operative organizations.
Their members outstay their period of usefulness and
retain permanent places in the orchestra after they should
give way to younger and better men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The readings of Nikisch were distinctly personal and
therefore, because they reflected his own nature, so ingratiating
that I have often enjoyed certain of his interpretations
although I considered them wrong and contrary
to the intentions of the composer. Nikisch made
them convincing for the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor Muck, who became conductor of the Boston
Symphony some years later, was less personal in his readings.
His principal work in Germany had been the conducting
of opera, and occasionally a lack of routine in
symphonic work showed itself in badly combined programmes,
but only in that one respect. As a conductor
of the symphonies of Beethoven and Brahms he was a
master, and to me his interpretations of Brahms rank
among the finest that I have heard. It was a tragedy
that this man, who had gained not only the confidence
and respect of his patron, Major Higginson, to a greater
degree than any other of the Boston conductors, who was
admired not only in Boston but in every city which the
orchestra visited, and to whom America had given unbounded
acclaim, should at the crucial moment have
proved himself a supercilious, arrogant Prussian of the
worst Junker type, ungrateful toward the man to whom
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
he owed his many successful years in America, and finally
even an abject coward and renegade toward the country
to which he owed national allegiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story in its entirety is too unpleasant to be told,
but as after Muck’s return to Germany he saw fit to indulge
in the most violent diatribes against America and
its treatment of him, it is justifiable to tell a little of the
truth in these pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to understand the story properly it is necessary
to recall the excitement which swept through the
country when we finally entered the Great War. Wars
arouse prejudice as well as patriotism, and suspicion as
well as faith. One of the curious, almost pathological,
results of the psychosis of war is the spy mania, and this
manifested itself in the years of 1917 and 1918 to a remarkable
extent—in America as well as in Europe. One
need only recall the many stories of concrete tennis-courts
which were discovered and vouched for by reputable
people as having been built years before by German
army officers, who, disguised as “rich American financiers”
(!) had constructed lavish country places along
the Atlantic seaboard, all of which possessed these remarkable
concrete tennis-courts. These were to support
great guns which at the proper moment were to put
the American navy out of existence! There were also
wonderful stories of secret wires discovered in private
houses, and of strange beacon-lights suddenly flaming up
at regular intervals along the coast in order to signal
messages to some mysterious German submarine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all like a war novel of Oppenheim, and as some
of our ladies joined the secret-service in an unofficial
capacity, they together with others—who conceived it to
be the height of faithlessness to our country to enjoy a
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
symphony of Beethoven or an opera of Wagner while
we were at war with Germany—had a beautiful time in
the happy illusion that they were doing real war work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doctor Muck immediately became a centre of suspicion.
He had taken a cottage at Seal Harbor, Maine,
for the summer of 1917, and of course he was immediately
accused of having a wireless outfit and signalling to a
whole fleet of German submarines which were cruising off
Mount Desert Island and whose immediate object was,
of course, to capture all the millionaires of Bar Harbor
and hold them captives for huge ransoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to others he had placed a telephone receiver
in the cellar of his house in Boston which skilfully tapped
the wire of the telephone of the lady next door, and she,
to her horror, had one morning on lifting her telephone, in
order to call up her butcher, heard his “guttural” German
voice conversing with some mysterious German at the
other end about a shipment of dynamite, which was to be
used, of course, to destroy Faneuil Hall and the birthplace
of Henry W. Longfellow in Maine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not a story so wild that it did not gain credence,
but it was not so strange that many of these preposterous
rumors should centre around Doctor Muck.
His attitude toward us had become more and more supercilious.
That he should sympathize with his own country
was perhaps natural, but that he should use some tact
and reticence in this respect was equally to be expected.
He might have taken example from Fritz Kreisler who,
as an Austrian citizen, served at the beginning of the war
in the Austrian army, but was retired and returned to
this country before we entered the conflict. From then
on he acted with such dignity and tact, giving up all
playing in public during that critical period, that he retained
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
the personal respect and affection of all right-thinking
Americans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the war situation became more and more serious,
Doctor Muck seemed to become more and more supercilious.
In response to a perfectly natural impulse, the
public demanded that our orchestras begin or end their
concerts with the playing of the national anthem. This
had become the symbol of our patriotism, and as millions
of our young men began to gather in the camps and to be
sent abroad in the transports, “The Star-Spangled Banner”
was beginning to awaken in every heart emotions
that were hardly known to our generation before the war.
Doctor Muck refused to play the anthem. Not from
Boston nor New York, alas, but from Providence, Baltimore,
and Pittsburgh angry mutterings began to be heard.
These cities insisted that an orchestra which in time of
war was not willing to play our national anthem should
not be permitted to play at all. Doctor Muck’s answer
to this, in a newspaper interview, was that he conducted
an artistic institution, that “The Star-Spangled Banner”
is not a work of art, and therefore “only fit to be played
by ballroom orchestras and military bands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up till then I had upheld Doctor Muck in so far as it
seemed just as bad taste for him, as a German, to conduct
our national hymn in time of war with his country
as it was for our public to insist that a German should
do so. He could have said: “I am a German; my country
is at war with yours. I am your guest because in 1915
Major Higginson insisted that I should return to America
as he thought that the orchestra could not exist without
me. I am now in an unfortunate position. Let me retire
from conducting here during the war, or at least let your
national anthem be conducted by the concert master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
But this interview was a flippant evasion of the real
point at issue, and when the reporter of the <span class='it'>New York
Tribune</span> brought it to me, I exclaimed that I did not believe
Doctor Muck could have said anything so outrageous,
whereupon the reporter told me that his editor had
expected me to say this and had therefore telegraphed to
Boston and obtained a confirmation of the interview. I
then expressed myself in very plain language regarding
Doctor Muck’s attitude, but his only answer was a new
interview in which he declared that it was all a mistake,
that he was not a German but a Swiss! This belated
claim, which was based on technicalities and contrary
to the facts, was promptly denied by the Swiss minister
in Washington, and then suddenly Doctor Muck proceeded
to conduct “The Star-Spangled Banner,” but in
listless fashion, although half a dozen cities by that time
barred their doors to him and the concerts of the orchestra
had to be cancelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the secret-service men of the government
had been patiently following every rumor and clew
regarding Muck’s supposed spy activities, and while they
discovered that his attitude toward us was absolutely
inimical and that he was therefore decidedly <span class='it'>persona non
grata</span>, there was no foundation of truth in the rumors
connecting him with wires, wireless, beacon-lights, dynamite,
or German submarines. The secret-service men,
however, discovered other disagreeable things in regard
to him which had no connection with the war but which
made him liable under the laws of our country. An incriminating
package of letters was shown to him, and on
his acknowledgment that he had written them he was
given the choice of internment as a prisoner of war at
Fort Oglethorpe or of being arrested on another charge
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
and brought before the civil courts for trial. He naturally
threw up his hands and accepted the former as the
lesser evil. As he was released after the war on condition
that he return to his own country, I cannot see that he
has cause for anything but gratitude toward this country
and its lenient treatment of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole affair was a terrible shock to Major Higginson.
He was an old man and the discoveries regarding
Doctor Muck, in whom he had placed such confidence
and for whom he had vouched so absolutely, were unendurable
to him. He had expected to continue his support
of the orchestra, and it was generally assumed that
he would leave the organization an endowment sufficient
to maintain it after his death. Instead of this, he announced
his determination to withdraw altogether, and
left the decision whether they wished to continue the orchestra
with a group of music lovers whom he had called
together. For a time its future was in great doubt.
Thirty of the players were discharged because of their
German nationality, but money was subscribed by various
Boston citizens to rebuild the orchestra, and to-day,
under the leadership of Pierre Monteux, it is fast regaining
its old excellence. It will never again occupy the unique
position it held twenty-five years and more ago, because
since then so many other symphony orchestras have been
founded in America on similar lines and with similar generous
endowments. But to Major Higginson will always
belong the glory of having blazed the trail. He set the
standard, and America will give his memory loving reverence
and gratitude.</p>

<h3>MARGARET ANGLIN AND THE GREEK PLAYS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>During the winter of 1915 I received a letter from Margaret
Anglin, our distinguished American actress, asking
me to compose the incidental music for two Greek plays
which she intended to produce the following summer at
the great open-air Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California.
The plays selected were the “Iphigenia in Aulis” of Euripides
and “Medea” of Sophocles. I was fascinated by
the problem involved, as it necessitated not only the composing
of the music but the creation of a form in which it
was to be cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know very little of the music of the ancient Greeks,
and if we sought to imitate that, it would sound so archaic
and even unnatural to our modern ears as to fail in properly
supporting the emotions of the drama for us. While
the Greeks had developed the technic of the drama to
a remarkable extent, music as an art was at that time
in its infancy, although its importance was fully recognized
by Plato and the great dramatists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The problem for me was to write music which should
take full advantage of the modern development of harmony
and orchestration, and form an emotional current
on which the drama could float without being in any way
submerged. The treatment of the Greek chorus was another
problem for which I had no precedents. Mendelssohn
had written incidental music to “Antigone,”
but this music does not represent Mendelssohn at his
best, as much of it is dry and academic in character.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
The Greek choruses usually begin with a recital of some
old story of mythology, with which every Greek in the
audience of that era had been familiar since childhood.
Gradually this story is brought into connection with the
situation on the stage and reaches its climax when the
chorus implores the actors to draw their lesson from it.
These choruses I treated in various ways, according to
the needs of the dramatic situation. Some were recited
to a soft but expressive undercurrent of music, others
were sung, and still others were a combination of both.
I would have the story of the old Greek legend recited by
the first leader of the chorus. Then the second leader,
as he applied it to the dramatic situation, would burst
into song, until, in the third phase, the entire chorus would
join in their impassioned pleadings or warnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the spring of 1915 I took a little cottage in Setauket,
Long Island, and there within six weeks wrote the entire
music for the two plays, the orchestra parts being copied
sheet by sheet as my score was finished. In June I packed
them in my bag and travelled across the continent to meet
Margaret Anglin and take charge of the musical part of
the production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On arriving in San Francisco I found the great World’s
Fair already in full operation. Its Spanish architecture
and the luxuriant verdure in which it was enclosed made
it a perfect dream of beauty, but I gave myself little opportunity
to enjoy it, as my real mission was across the
bay at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, where Margaret
Anglin and a company of players were already busily
engaged from morning till evening in rehearsing. They
were anxiously awaiting my music in order to make it
fit in properly with the stage arrangements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Greek Theatre at the California University is one
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>
of the most remarkable structures of its kind in the world.
Built amphitheatrically against the side of a hill and absolutely
on the lines of the old Greek theatres, its top is
fringed by sombre eucalyptus-trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few years before I had seen a performance of the
“Bacchante” of Euripides given by a company of Roman
actors at an antique amphitheatre on the side of a hill
overlooking Florence. Much of this performance had
been impressive, but the music was tawdry, and as the
play was given according to old Greek custom in the late
afternoon, the cruel sunlight made the make-up of the
actors and the garish colors of their costumes doubly
prosaic. The ancient Greeks had no artificial lighting
and were therefore compelled to give their performances
in daylight, although they sought to temper it so that
night would fall at about the end of the play. Margaret
Anglin, with her characteristic genius, perceived that a
much greater glamour and stage illusion could be produced
by giving her performances at night, leaving the
audience in darkness and marking out the stage with
great electric lights from above, which could be heightened
or lessened according to the actual needs of the
drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the drama in America had been treated as seriously
by its cultured citizens as music has been, Margaret Anglin
would perhaps be to-day the artistic head of an endowed
theatre devoted to productions of Shakespeare, Goethe,
Molière, Calderon, Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.
These great masters of the stage would form just as important
a part of her repertoire as the symphonies of
Beethoven and Brahms make up an important part of
the programmes of the New York Symphony Orchestra.
Margaret Anglin is to-day the greatest tragedienne of the
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
American stage, and should be acting <span class='it'>Medea</span> and <span class='it'>Lady
Macbeth</span>. But instead of that she has to tour the country,
playing “Green Stockings” and similar piffle, and
only indulges her artistic ambitions and ideals in occasional
productions of Greek dramas at her own risk
and very much at her own expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was immensely interested in the rehearsals on the
stage of the Greek Theatre. They began at nine-thirty
in the morning and would often last—with an intermission
of an hour or two for lunch—until eight o’clock at night,
but as they were held outdoors in the glorious fresh air
of California there was but little fatigue, and all concerned
gave themselves up enthusiastically to Miss Anglin’s
direction and picturesque conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had hired a bungalow near the theatre and a
Japanese butler-cook. This little Jap would always appear
at one o’clock with a basket filled with the most delicious
luncheon dishes, artistically decorated in real
Japanese style by his own deft fingers. He seemed to
have a great penchant for the stage, asserted that he had
acted <span class='it'>Hamlet</span> in Japan, and would sit for hours after
luncheon watching the rehearsal, with his little inscrutable
eyes fixed on the stage. I have often wondered whether
on his return to Japan he gave performances of the Greek
plays to his own compatriots and whether any great
changes or adaptations were necessary to make them comprehensible
to his audiences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the general plan of the action and grouping had
been carefully worked out by Miss Anglin, she had an
open mind and eye, and would often change the arrangement
completely if an improvement could be effected
thereby. This meant incessant repetitions, during which
her patience and cheerful courtesy never failed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
A grand piano had been rolled into a corner of the
stage, and I was so fascinated in watching the rehearsals
and the gradual evolution of the stage pictures under
her skilful hands, that I insisted on always playing the
incidental music myself, even though some of the scenes
were repeated dozens of times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Anglin had enlisted the services of fourteen of
California University’s loveliest and most talented coeds
to form her Greek chorus. Beauty seems to flourish
naturally on the Pacific coast, and some of these young
ladies were glorious specimens of a truly Greek and
statuesque charm. The recitation of one of the choruses,
which was to be spoken in a kind of elastic rhythm to
the music of the orchestra, was intrusted to one of these
Dianas of Berkeley, and as she had no conception of
this, to her, novel combination, Miss Anglin asked me to
give her a separate rehearsal after lunch. I sat down at
the piano and recited the chorus to her while I played
the accompanying music. She stood by my side listening
intently and looking like a statue of Diana of Ephesus.
Then, bending her head with stately dignity, she said:
“I get ya!” Alas! the illusion was gone, and her voice
brought me back suddenly from my dream of 400 B. C.
to California of 1915. She had not “got me,” however,
and I was finally compelled to give this chorus to another
young lady, less statuesque in form but more clever in
achieving plastic unity between speech and music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But my real troubles began when I tried to collect an
orchestra of fifty for the performances. At that time
there were not many good players in San Francisco, and
even those few were permanently engaged in the big
World’s Fair orchestra. My first rehearsal was truly
pathetic—I had been so spoiled by the many years of
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
association with my lovely New York Symphony Orchestra.
But where there is a will there is a way, and
by stealing a few men from the local theatres and borrowing
a few more from the exposition orchestras, we
were enabled to get a fairly good body of men assembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The success of Miss Anglin’s productions was truly
remarkable. There were ten thousand people at each
performance, and “Iphigenia in Aulis” had to be repeated
twice. In this work the camp of <span class='it'>Agamemnon</span> and
its atmosphere of war were graphically illustrated, and
five hundred Berkeley students, picturesquely attired
and well trained, gave a very vivid picture of the soldier’s
camp, especially at the end of the play when the Oracle
has announced that the wind has changed, and these
hundreds of soldiers rushed across the stage in a tumult
of joy to board their ships and sail for Troy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Electra,” for which William Furst had written
music for Miss Anglin years before, was also performed.
Eventually I also composed music for this play, and all
three of the dramas were performed in New York a few
years later at the request of Mr. Flagler, on the stage of
Carnegie Hall, which had been skilfully converted for
the occasion into a Greek theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all marvelled how vividly modern these plays,
written more than two thousand years ago, seemed as
given under the artistic direction of Margaret Anglin.
<span class='it'>Electra</span>, waiting outside the walls of the palace for the
sound that shall announce to her the death of <span class='it'>Ægisthus</span>
and <span class='it'>Clytemnestra</span>; <span class='it'>Medea</span>, having entered the palace to
kill her own and <span class='it'>Jason’s</span> children in order to punish him
for his marriage to the young Princess, while the chorus,
shaking the iron grill of the doors, implore <span class='it'>Medea</span> not to
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
slay her children; <span class='it'>Iphigenia</span>, youngest daughter of <span class='it'>Agamemnon</span>,
descending alone the great flight of steps to
suffer death in the sacred grove of the goddess Artemis,
that her wrath may be appeased and favorable winds
may send the armies of <span class='it'>Agamemnon</span> to Troy—all these
are unforgettable scenes, and I was overjoyed to feel
that the music which I had written was not inappropriate,
but formed a good background for these crucial
moments.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span><h1>XX</h1></div>

<h3>DEAD COMPOSERS</h3>

<p class='pindent'>I have a large library of musical works. It was begun
by my father in 1857, and contains many scores of
the composers of that period, sent to him for first performance
in Germany. He added to it considerably
during his thirteen years in America as founder and conductor
of the Symphony and Oratorio Societies, and I
have still further enlarged it since I became conductor of
these two organizations. My library now virtually represents
the entire symphonic development up to the
present time, and as I look through my catalogue I am
amazed at the number of dead composers which it contains.
By this I do not mean those who have passed
away, but those who were once celebrated, were hailed
as great, but whose works are now forgotten and only
repose undisturbed on dusty shelves like mine, for no
efforts or housewife’s art will prevent dust from seeping
into the shelves of a New York City library!</p>

<p class='pindent'>To mention a few of these “dead” composers alphabetically:
Who now plays the overtures of Auber’s “La
Muette de Portici” and “Fra Diavolo”? Yet they figured
frequently in my popular programmes thirty years
ago, and both operas deserve more than a passing recognition.
The first was a stroke of genius in which the
commonplace Auber rose to real heights. The heroine
is a dumb girl, a prima donna without a voice, but very
dramatically portrayed in the orchestra, and the atmosphere
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
of a people fighting for freedom pervades the entire
story. “Fra Diavolo” is a delightful comic opera. The
only trouble is that the music is too good for the abjectly
dull audiences that now frequent our theatres and want
to see a “musical show.” Its plot is delightfully consistent,
which is another reason for looking on it with
disfavor to-day; but I have always regretted the Nemesis
which overcomes <span class='it'>Fra Diavolo</span> in the last act. This delightful
robber has by that time so endeared himself to
us that he should be allowed at the end to escape, in
order that the public may live in the hope of further
pranks and misdeeds from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirty years ago I gave the first performance in America
of a “Symphony in D Minor,” by Anton Bruckner. He
was a man with the brains of a peasant but the soul of a
real musician, and with a marvellous gift for improvisation,
although he was, intellectually, incapable of developing
and balancing his themes properly. A noisy party
in Vienna wished, at the time, to acclaim this disciple of
Wagner as a genius, to counteract the constantly growing
admiration for Brahms, and more recently such eminent
conductors as Mahler have tried to popularize
Bruckner’s symphonies, but they have never gained a permanent
hold on our public. Several years after my performance
of his “Symphony in D,” I was in Berlin, and
Siegfried Ochs, the conductor of the famous Philharmonic
Choir, brought a little bald-headed man of over seventy
years of age to my table at the Kaiserhof. On my being
introduced to him, he suddenly grabbed my hand, and
saying, “You are the Mr. Damrosch who has given my
symphony in America!” he proceeded, to my great embarrassment,
to cover my hand with kisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vienna is full of stories of his childlike gentleness and
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
modesty. Hans Richter once invited him to conduct
one of his own symphonies with the famous orchestra of
the Vienna Society of Friends of Music. At the rehearsal
he stood on the conductor’s platform, stick in his hand,
with a beatific smile on his face. The orchestra were all
ready to begin, but he would not lift his stick to give the
signal. Finally Rosé, the concert master, said to him:
“We are quite ready. Begin, Herr Bruckner.” “Oh,
no,” he answered. “After you, gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time he was also commanded to appear before
the old Emperor Franz Joseph to receive a decoration.
After he had been decorated, the Emperor turned to him
and said very kindly: “Herr Bruckner, is there anything
more I can do for you?” Bruckner answered in a trembling
voice: “Won’t you please speak to Mr. Hanslick
(the famous musical critic of Vienna) that he should not
write such nasty criticisms about my symphonies?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my father’s time the overture to Cherubini’s
“Anacreon” had a frequent and honored place on his
programmes. A modern audience would vote it too dry
and old-fashioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music of Niels W. Gade was quite a favorite with
our grandfathers and grandmothers, but he is unendurable
to-day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new orchestral composition of Carl Goldmark was
eagerly waited for, forty years ago, and there was great
rivalry between my father and Theodore Thomas as to
which should have the privilege of performing it first.
People used to revel in his “exotic and luxuriant orchestration,”
but to-day his colors have faded before the
greater glories of Strauss and Debussy and Ravel, and
only his “Rustic Symphony” occasionally figures on
our programmes.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
During the second year of the German opera at the
Metropolitan, Goldmark’s “Queen of Sheba” made a
success which equalled that of the Wagner operas.
Solomon’s temple, painted in gold, the Jewish rituals,
the Oriental harmonies, and the naïve surprise of the
public on seeing biblical characters upon a modern
operatic stage, all combined to make the work a sensational
success. To-day it has disappeared completely
from the repertoire of European and American opera-houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fate of Franz Liszt as a composer is still more
tragic because it is partly undeserved. He created the
form of the symphonic poem, but those who succeeded
him have developed it so much farther as to leave his
works somewhat submerged. I still have great admiration
for his “Faust” Symphony, but neither I nor others
of my colleagues who share this admiration have been
able to make this work really popular with the general
public. His “Dante” Symphony, “Festklänge,” and
“Orpheus” receive still fewer public performances, and
his “Ce qu’on entend sur les montagnes” has never been
performed here to my knowledge. But “Les Préludes”
and the two Piano Concertos, on the contrary, are still
played <span class='it'>ad nauseam</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The symphonies of Gustav Mahler have never received
genuine recognition here, although he was a very
interesting apparition in the musical field. He was a
profound musician and one of the best conductors of
Europe, and it is possible that, in the latter capacity, he
occupied himself so intensely and constantly in analyzing
and interpreting the works of the great masters that he
lost the power to develop himself as composer on original
lines. All his life he composed, but his moments of real
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
beauty are too rare, and the listener has to wade through
pages of dreary emptiness which no artificial connection
with philosophic ideas can fill with real importance.
The feverish restlessness characteristic of the man reflects
itself in his music, which is fragmentary in character
and lacks continuity of thought and development.
He could write cleverly in the style of Haydn or Berlioz
or Wagner, and without forgetting Beethoven, but he
was never able to write in the style of Mahler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the greater composers of the last hundred years
no one has been killed oftener than Mendelssohn, yet he
always seems to come back again with a new renaissance.
His music for “Athalie,” his “Reformation” Symphony,
his overtures to “Melusine” and “Ruy Blas” are dead
as a door-nail, but his Violin Concerto is still the most
perfect example of its kind, his “Midsummer Night’s
Dream” the best incidental music ever conceived for a
Shakespearean play, his “Elijah” the most dramatic
oratorio ever written, and the Scotch and Italian Symphonies
still possess a delightful and eternal charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The works of Meyerbeer, on the contrary, have deservedly
disappeared even from our popular programmes.
Those empty “Torchlight Dances” and the vulgar ballet
music from “Le Prophète”! I confess, though, that I
still have a sneaking fondness for the “Coronation
March,” perhaps because I had to conduct it so many
times at the Metropolitan, when I first began conducting
the operas there. That the same man who penned
the glorious fourth act of the “Huguenots” could have
been satisfied with the empty drivel which preponderates
during the rest of that opera, is one of the eternal mysteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About thirty years ago Moritz Moszkowski was one
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
of the most popular composers of the day, especially for
the piano, but modern ears have but little use for his
delicate, though evanescent, charm, and his orchestral
suites are but rarely heard to-day. He has lived in
Paris for many years, and during the war he suffered
greatly. Advancing years and a long illness had left
him very weak, and it seemed almost as if the musical
world in which he had been so popular a figure had forgotten
him completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But last winter, Ernest Schelling, one of our best
American pianists, and an old friend of Moszkowski’s,
conceived the happy idea of giving a testimonial concert
in his honor, which should be thoroughly original in
character. He, together with his distinguished colleague,
Harold Bauer, accordingly enlisted the co-operation of
twelve other celebrated pianists who were in America
during the winter. This list, a truly remarkable one,
included Elly Ney, Ignaz Friedman, Ossip Gabrilowitsch,
Rudolph Ganz, Leopold Godowsky, Percy Grainger,
Ernest Hutcheson, Alexander Lambert, Josef Lhevinne,
Yolanda Mero, Germaine Schnitzer, and Sigismond
Stojowski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flagler offered the services of our orchestra, but
as the stage was to be completely filled with fourteen
grand pianos, there was no room for an orchestra, and I
had to content myself with the possibility of being taken
on as a piano mover, as I longed to take part in the affair
in any capacity. The morning before the concert, however,
I received a hurried S. O. S. telephone call from
Ernest Schelling. He said: “Please come down to
Steinway’s immediately and help us out. The fourteen
pianists are all here for rehearsal. We have arranged
for several compositions to be played by all of us, but
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
alas, each one has his own individual interpretation, and
nothing seems to make us play together. We need a
conductor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I arrived at the rehearsal hall the confusion was
indeed indescribable, and it took some time to bring
order out of chaos. Here were fourteen of the world’s
greatest pianists, veritable prima donnas of the piano,
but several had never learned to adapt themselves to
play together for a common musical purpose, and when
I rapped on my stand for silence in order to begin the
“Spanish Dances” of Moszkowski, at least five or six
continued their infernal improvising, playing of scales,
and pianistic fireworks. By using heroic measures I gradually
produced a semblance of order, and gave the signal
for the beginning of the music. The effect was extraordinary!
Several of these pianists had never followed
a conductor’s beat, and after the first ten bars, two of
them rushed over to me, the one violently exclaiming
that the tempo was too fast, and the other insisting with
equal vehemence that it was too slow. Finally I obtained
silence, and told my pianistic orchestra that they
were, undoubtedly, the fourteen greatest pianists in the
world, and that the interpretation of each one of them
was undoubtedly equally the greatest in the world, but
as they represented fourteen different grades and shades
of interpretation, I intended to take the matter into my
own hands and they would just have to follow my beat
whether they liked my tempo or not. This was greeted
with a roar of approval, and we now settled down to the
work of rehearsing as solemnly as if these prima donnas
of the ivories were orchestral musicians and routined
members of the New York Musical Union. Order followed
anarchy, and the results achieved were not without
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
higher artistic interest, especially as I detailed such
accomplished and routined musicians as Harold Bauer,
Ernest Schelling, and Ossip Gabrilowitsch to use their
own discretion in “orchestrating” the “Dances.” Gabrilowitsch,
for instance, reserved himself for the entrance of
the “brasses”; Bauer invested some of the more delicate
portions with agile runs of flutes and clarinets, while
Schelling imitated the kettledrums and cymbals with
thrilling effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carnegie Hall was jammed and the audience in a gale
of happiness at the highly original proceedings. The
stage was so crowded with the fourteen huge pianos that,
after threading my way through them to introduce
Mme. Alma Gluck, who was to auction off one of the
programmes, I said that what this concert evidently
needed most was not a conductor but a traffic policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the most artistic feature of the programme
was the performance of Schumann’s “Carnival Scenes,”
in which each little movement represents a separate
carnival figure. The fourteen pianists drew lots as to
which was to play which. The introduction was played
by all, but after that, in quick kaleidoscopic succession,
the different carnival figures fairly danced from the stage
into the audience, as a pianist on one side of the stage
would begin, followed by one from the other side, and so
on. It was a most remarkable opportunity to compare
the interpretative characteristics of the different pianists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The receipts were considerably swelled by the auctioning
of programmes and autographed photographs of
Moszkowski, and fifteen thousand dollars was the result
of an entertainment truly unique in the history of
music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most popular modern symphonic composer in the
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
’70’s was Joachim Raff. He was a young Swiss who,
without a cent in his pocket, had walked many miles
from his little village in order to hear Liszt play at a
concert in Zurich. Liszt became interested in his undoubted
talent, and took him with him to Weimar as
musical secretary. Raff, von Bülow, and my father became
great friends. But while every one expected that
Raff would continue as a true disciple of Liszt’s, and
write in the revolutionary style of his master, he gradually
turned from him and leaned more and more on
classic models, although in several of his symphonies he
retained the Lisztian idea of programme music. As he
grew older his conservatism became more and more
marked. He had great facility and produced works in
every known form of music, and his vanity gradually
made him believe that his string quartets were equal to
Mozart’s, his symphonies to Beethoven’s, and his oratorios
to Handel’s and Mendelssohn’s. His fecundity
was astonishing, but his pen too fluent for real musical
depth. There was hardly a winter, however, that Theodore
Thomas or my father did not perform “Im Walde,”
or the very programmatic “Lenore” Symphony. This
work, in which the last movement follows closely and
dramatically Burger’s famous ballad, had an enormous
popularity, and is occasionally performed by us to-day,
but in general the name of Raff means but little to modern
concertgoers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But perhaps the greatest tragedy of all was Anton
Rubinstein, who became, after Liszt, the world’s greatest
piano virtuoso. The world fêted him, spoiled him, and
sated him with adulation. It all brought him no satisfaction.
He was consumed with the ambition to be considered
a great composer, and wrote incessantly, never
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
criticising what he wrote. His “Ocean” Symphony had
a tremendous popularity in New York fifty years ago,
but to-day no one would listen to it. His “D Minor
Concerto” has been played, <span class='it'>ad nauseam</span>, by every pianist,
but to-day it is threadbare and frayed at the edges.
Only the supreme skill of a Josef Hofmann can make his
“G Major Concerto” endurable and cloak its musical
emptiness. He wrote opera after opera in a feverish desire
to eclipse Wagner, whom he hated, and whose popularity
he envied, and after “Parsifal” had been proclaimed
at Bayreuth as a “Sacred Festival Play,” he immediately
proceeded to write an opera on the life of Christ,
which is so dull and unconvincing that it has hardly had a
performance anywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His personal popularity was so great that Pollini, the
astute manager of the Hamburg Opera, occasionally used
to put on one of his operas on condition that he himself
would come to Hamburg to conduct the opening performance.
His presence would insure a crowded house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the last rehearsal of one of these operas Rubinstein
was so well pleased with the work of the orchestra that
he turned to them and said: “Gentlemen, if my opera is
a success you must all come to my hotel after the performance
for a champagne supper.” Unfortunately, the
opera was a decided frost and the audience so undemonstrative
that Rubinstein, in absolute disgust, laid
down the stick after the second act, and, bidding the
local conductor finish the opera, returned dejectedly to
his hotel and went to bed. At eleven o’clock there was
a knock at his door. “Who is it?” he shouted in great
irritation. “It is I, Herr Rubinstein, the double-bass
player from the opera orchestra.” “What do you
want?” “I have come for the champagne supper.”
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
“What nonsense!” raged Rubinstein. “The opera was a
ghastly failure.” “Well, Herr Rubinstein,” answered the
thirsty and undaunted double-bass player, “<span class='it'>I</span> liked it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disappearance of Schumann’s symphonies from
concert programmes is due to the fact that he was never
at ease in writing for the orchestra. His instrumentation
is so thick and turgid as to be the despair of conductors.
So much of the music is exquisite, but it is like a precious
jewel imbedded in a foreign substance which conductors
try in vain to remove by changing the dynamics of this
or that instrument, or by leaving out an unnecessary
doubling up of certain harmonies. All these devices,
however, can do but little. More heroic measures are
necessary, and I was much interested last summer when
Sir Edward Elgar asked me what I would think of his
deliberately reorchestrating an entire symphony of Schumann’s.
I heartily applauded such an idea and begged
him to carry it out speedily as there is perhaps no one
living to-day who better understands the colors of the orchestra
and knows how to produce the most subtle shades
in the intermingling of the different instruments. In the
meantime Frederick Stock, the noted conductor of the
Chicago Orchestra, has taken the bull by the horns and
has written a new orchestration of Schumann’s “Rhenish
Symphony” which I hope to produce this winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are Sousa’s marches played nowadays? They should
be. They are better than the military marches of Europe
of to-day, and while one cannot put them into the category
of higher musical efforts they are the only American
compositions of musical worth that have triumphantly
blazed their way all over the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Strauss, who twenty-five years ago was the
most interesting star in the musical firmament, has lived
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>
long enough to have outlived a part of his popularity.
He never originated a musical form, but accepted the
symphonic poem of Liszt and the music-drama of Wagner
as models. His workmanship is infinitely greater than
Liszt’s, his counterpoint stupendous in its boldness, and
in his treatment of the orchestra he sometimes transcends
even Wagner in the originality of his orchestral combinations.
But his compositions lack the ideality of either of
these masters, and because of this and in spite of his marvellous
paraphernalia, his works seem to carry within
them the seeds of their own decay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gods endowed this man at his birth perhaps more
richly than any other musician of our time, but something
within him has made him relinquish the greatest of their
gifts and has turned him to less pure ideals. In the “Sinfonia
Domestica” the daily life of husband, wife, and
baby are characterized by an orchestra of one hundred
and ten players with such noisy fury and realistic prose
as to give one an altogether distorted insight into what is
supposedly a page from the composer’s diary. But the
music descriptive of the composer who, after these dreadful
domestic squabbles, retires to his workroom, lights
his lamp, and begins to communicate with his muse, is so
beautiful as to fill us with a deep regret that one so winged
for flight in the ether should be so content to walk on the
earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instrumental devices, depicting <span class='it'>Don Quixote’s</span> adventure
with the sheep and his fight with the windmill,
which aroused such astonishment and admiration when
they were first heard, have already lost their effect and are
listened to to-day with hardly a smile. The final scene,
however, depicting the dying of <span class='it'>Don Quixote</span>, is so beautiful
and tragic in its expression as to bring tears to the
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
listener. The “Heldenleben” is to me a work of noisy
bombastic emptiness from beginning to end, and one
might call it typical of certain German currents of to-day.
It would, however, be manifestly unfair to call it
typically German, as a race that has produced Bach,
Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner will surely find other
men to continue their glorious traditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A composer’s fame is not affirmed by professional musicians
but by the general public whose judgment in the
end is infallible. A great masterwork that is not destroyed
will always eventually be recognized as such whether, like
the “Venus de Milo,” it has lain hidden for centuries beneath
the earth or, like the “Matthew Passion” of Bach,
equally hidden in the dusty shelves of the Royal Library
of Berlin, to be rediscovered by Mendelssohn and pronounced
the greatest religious choral work ever written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two works of Strauss which have retained their
popularity with the public are undoubtedly his best, as
their requirements do not enlist such qualities as he
does not possess or has not sought to develop. In “Till
Eulenspiegel” Strauss’s talent for mordant realism finds
full expression. The wild pranks of <span class='it'>Eulenspiegel</span> follow
each other in mad, cynical humor, and, in the limited
form of programme music, the work is flawless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His “Salome” is as perfect a union with Oscar Wilde’s
marvellous play as the “Pélléas” and “Mélisande” of
Maeterlinck and Debussy. In both the composers have
so steeped themselves in the spirit of the poem as to enhance
its beauty. But with all my admiration for
“Salome” I have never been able to sit through the
final scene without a feeling of disgust, which sometimes
mounted even to physical nausea. When <span class='it'>Salome</span> sings
her horrible love music to the head of <span class='it'>John the Baptist</span> it
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
has always seemed to me a parody on the glorious finale
of “Tristan and Isolde.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have spoken in another chapter of Tschaikowsky’s
visit to America in 1891 as a guest of the Symphony
Society. For twenty-five years his popularity was enormous
and the mere announcement of his “Symphonie
Pathétique” was sufficient to draw a crowded house.
His symphonies appeared more often on our concert
programmes than those of any other composer. They
have a rhythmic and elemental strength which appealed
even to the unmusical, but to-day a distinct lessening of
this popularity is noticeable. There is a lack of real symphonic
development of his themes, and certain crudities
of workmanship stand out more clearly as the works
have become better known. Young conductors, anxious
for ready and cheap applause, still choose one of his symphonies
for their début, and the melodic charm of his
lighter music, if not heard too often, will retain its place
in the affection of our public for some time longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we come to the greatest genius of the nineteenth
century—Richard Wagner. “What!” exclaims
my reader. “Do you consider him dead?” God forbid!
The wings of his genius are still soaring aloft in
the ether, but there is no doubt that the attitude of the
world of to-day toward his music is absolutely different
from that of fifty or sixty years ago when he first electrified
or infuriated a public, amazed at his daring innovations.
The inevitable has happened—Wagner has become
a “classic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was a boy of fifteen when I heard the first performance
of “Lohengrin” at the old Academy of Music. The
opera was sung in Italian with Italo Campanini as <span class='it'>Lohengrin</span>,
Valeria as <span class='it'>Elsa</span>, and our own Anne Louise Cary as
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
<span class='it'>Ortrude</span>. The conductor was old Luigi Arditi. I sat in
the front row in the family circle, and was so excited by
the drama and the music that at the end of the double
male chorus—which accompanies the approach of <span class='it'>Lohengrin</span>
in the boat drawn by the swan as the God-sent deliverer
of <span class='it'>Elsa</span>—the tears rushed down my cheeks. But
they were happy tears and a natural relief from the tension
which the music had created in me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each succeeding opera of Wagner’s was a similar
revelation. I pored over the scores of the “Nibelungen
Trilogy” during every hour left me from school work
and piano practice. In fact, I often stole time from the
latter and would gladly have given up my entire school if
my parents had not very properly kept me where I belonged.
Later on my founding of the Damrosch Opera
Company for the sole purpose of producing Wagner
operas seemed an inner necessity, and I was driven to it
by a force stronger than myself. For years a Wagner
programme, whether it was at a symphony concert in New
York, or in Oklahoma on a Western tour, or at the Willow
Grove summer concerts, drew the largest audiences,
and the same orchestral excerpts were repeated by me
and other conductors year after year and received by our
public with excited enthusiasm. To-day the amazement
which his music called forth is no longer apparent. He
is admired and loved, but the nerves of the younger generation
are not thrilled by his harmonies as ours were.
His works repose upon our shelves bound in morocco and
gold and occupy places of honor, but, alas, on several
of them the dust is beginning to gather and many of the
young people of to-day find “Lohengrin” monotonous,
and vote unanimously that <span class='it'>Tannhäuser’s</span> recital of his
pilgrimage to Rome is too long.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
Time and continued occupation with Wagner’s music
may have made me more critical and analytical, and I
am no longer in complete and enthusiastic accord with
some of his theories regarding the music-drama. But
much of his music still sweeps me off my feet, and his
“Meistersinger”—which is so happy and perfect a compromise
between the opera and the music-drama—is to
me still the greatest musical work of our times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have spoken above of the finality of the judgment of
the public regarding the ultimate vitality of an art work.
Conductors have had their personal convictions and have
tried to force them upon our audiences, but unless these
convictions were based on actual worth the public has
in the end consciously or unconsciously rejected them.
Sometimes unworthy composers have had momentary
popularity, but they were born but to dance in the sun
for one day and then to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My orchestral parts of the symphonies of Beethoven,
Mozart, and Brahms are old and worn by many rehearsals
and performances, and some of them have been patched
up and pasted together by my librarian so many times
that they have had to be replaced by new ones twice
over. I have performed them for nearly forty years, and
the grandchildren of my audiences of 1885 are now listening
to them with equal happiness. A few years ago I
discovered a lovely symphony by Mozart, which had
never been played in New York, and I was as proud of
this as if it had been the fourth dimension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The works of these masters are lifted above the fashion
of the moment, and their creators smile upon us serenely
and eternally from the heavens in which they dwell as
gods among the gods.</p>

<h3>POSTLUDE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>These reminiscences were begun in New York in April,
1922, and finished the following August in Bar Harbor,
Maine. My friends had urged me for some time to write
down my experiences because they thought that the
many and varied events in a long musical life would
prove interesting to American musicians and readers
generally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know. On re-reading the foregoing pages
in the proof-sheets I feel that many happenings which
seemed of great importance to me may prove but dull
reading to others. But at least I have tried to tell a
truthful tale and to give an honest account of my aspirations
and struggles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have climbed a few hills, but only to see the mountains
beyond rising higher and higher, the path upward
often indiscernible through the mists surrounding the
peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I love the people among whom my father settled because
he firmly believed that in America his children
would have a greater opportunity for development than
in old Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The musical field in America is certainly wonderful in
its possibilities, and all my life I have reached out with
both hands and have worked incessantly and enthusiastically
in my calling. In part at least I have tried to
repay what I owe to my compatriots for their confidence
and help. But the power of the individual is comparatively
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
small, and while our musicians have already accomplished
miracles within the short period that music
has played a part in our civilization, so much yet remains
to be done that I long for at least one hundred more years
of life, partly to continue my work but still more to
satisfy my eager curiosity as to the musical future of our
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this book serves to encourage my younger colleagues
in their efforts to increase the love and appreciation of
music in our country, it has not been written in vain.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
